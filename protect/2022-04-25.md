* Summary: With the present highly infectious dominant SARS-CoV-2 strain of B1.1.529 or
Omicron spreading around the globe, there is concern that the COVID-19 pandemic
will not end soon and that it will be a race against time until a more
contagious and virulent variant emerges. One of the most promising approaches
for preventing virus propagation is to maintain continuous high vaccination
efficacy among the population, thereby strengthening the population protective
effect and preventing the majority of infection in the vaccinated population,
as is known to occur with the Omicron variant frequently. Countries must
structure vaccination programs in accordance with their populations'
susceptibility to infection, optimizing vaccination efforts by delivering
vaccines progressively enough to protect the majority of the population. We
present a feasibility study proposal for maintaining optimal continuous
vaccination by assessing the susceptible population, the decline of vaccine
efficacy in the population, and advising booster dosage deployment to maintain
the population's protective efficacy through the use of a predictive model.
Numerous studies have been conducted in the direction of analyzing vaccine
utilization; however, very little study has been conducted to substantiate the
optimal deployment of booster dosage vaccination with the help of a predictive
model based on machine learning algorithms.

* Summary: CySecTool is a tool that finds a cost-optimal security controls portfolio in
a given budget for a probabilistic attack graph. A portfolio is a set of
counter-measures, or controls, against vulnerabilities adopted for a computer
system, while an attack graph is a type of a threat scenario model. In an
attack graph, nodes are privilege states of the attacker, edges are
vulnerabilities escalating privileges, and controls reduce the probabilities of
some vulnerabilities being exploited. The tool builds on an optimisation
algorithm published by Khouzani et al. (2019), enabling a user to quickly
create, edit, and incrementally improve models, analyse results for given
portfolios and display the best solutions for all possible budgets in the form
of a Pareto frontier. A case study was performed utilising a system graph and
suspected attack paths prepared by industrial security engineers based on an
industrial source with which they work. The goal of the case study is to model
a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) industrial system which, due
to having the potential to harm people, necessitates strong protection while
not allowing the use of typical penetration tools like vulnerability scanners.
Results are analysed to show how a cyber-security analyst would use CySecTool
to store cyber-security intelligence and draw further conclusions.

### Title: Cryptography Is Not Enough: Relay Attacks on Authenticated GNSS Signals

* Summary: Civilian-GNSS is vulnerable to signal spoofing attacks, and countermeasures
based on cryptographic authentication are being proposed to protect against
these attacks. Both Galileo and GPS are currently testing broadcast
authentication techniques based on the delayed key disclosure to validate the
integrity of navigation messages. These authentication mechanisms have proven
secure against record now and replay later attacks, as navigation messages
become invalid after keys are released. This work analyzes the security
guarantees of cryptographically protected GNSS signals and shows the
possibility of spoofing a receiver to an arbitrary location without breaking
any cryptographic operation. In contrast to prior work, we demonstrate the
ability of an attacker to receive signals close to the victim receiver and
generate spoofing signals for a different target location without modifying the
navigation message contents. Our strategy exploits the essential common
reception and transmission time method used to estimate pseudorange in GNSS
receivers, thereby rendering any cryptographic authentication useless. We
evaluate our attack on a commercial receiver (ublox M9N) and a software-defined
GNSS receiver (GNSS-SDR) using a combination of open-source tools, commercial
GNSS signal generators, and software-defined radio hardware platforms. Our
results show that it is possible to spoof a victim receiver to locations around
4000 km away from the true location without requiring any high-speed
communication networks or modifying the message contents. Through this work, we
further highlight the fundamental limitations in securing a broadcast
signaling-based localization system even if all communications are
cryptographically protected.

### Title: Go Wide or Go Deep: Levering Watermarking Performance with Computational Cost for Specific Images

* Summary: Digital watermarking has been widely studied for the protection of
intellectual property. Traditional watermarking schemes often design in a
"wider" rule, which applies one general embedding mechanism to all images. But
this will limit the scheme into a robustness-invisibility trade-off, where the
improvements of robustness can only be achieved by the increase of embedding
intensity thus causing the visual quality decay. However, a new scenario comes
out at this stage that many businesses wish to give high level protection to
specific valuable images, which requires high robustness and high visual
quality at the same time. Such scenario makes the watermarking schemes should
be designed in a "deeper" way which makes the embedding mechanism customized to
specific images. To achieve so, we break the robustness-invisibility trade-off
by introducing computation cost in, and propose a novel auto-decoder-like
image-specified watermarking framework (ISMark). Based on ISMark, the strong
robustness and high visual quality for specific images can be both achieved. In
detail, we apply an optimization procedure (OPT) to replace the traditional
embedding mechanism. Unlike existing schemes that embed watermarks using a
learned encoder, OPT regards the cover image as the optimizable parameters to
minimize the extraction error of the decoder, thus the features of each
specified image can be effectively exploited to achieve superior performance.
Extensive experiments indicate that ISMark outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods by a large margin, which improves the average bit error rate by 4.64%
(from 4.86% to 0.22%) and PSNR by 2.20dB (from 32.50dB to 34.70dB).

### Title: Simulation and performance analysis of quantum error correction with a rotated surface code under a realistic noise model

* Summary: The demonstration of quantum error correction (QEC) is one of the most
important milestones in the realization of fully-fledged quantum computers.
Toward this, QEC experiments using the surface codes have recently been
actively conducted. However, it has not yet been realized to protect logical
quantum information beyond the physical coherence time. In this work, we
performed a full simulation of QEC for the rotated surface codes with a code
distance 5, which employs 49 qubits and is within reach of the current
state-of-the-art quantum computers. In particular, we evaluate the logical
error probability in a realistic noise model that incorporates not only
stochastic Pauli errors but also coherent errors due to a systematic control
error or unintended interactions. While a straightforward simulation of 49
qubits is not tractable within a reasonable computational time, we reduced the
number of qubits required to 26 qubits by delaying the syndrome measurement in
simulation. This and a fast quantum computer simulator, Qulacs, implemented on
GPU allows us to simulate full QEC with an arbitrary local noise within
reasonable simulation time. Based on the numerical results, we also construct
and verify an effective model to incorporate the effect of the coherent error
into a stochastic noise model. This allows us to understand what the effect
coherent error has on the logical error probability on a large scale without
full simulation based on the detailed full simulation of a small scale. The
present simulation framework and effective model, which can handle arbitrary
local noise, will play a vital role in clarifying the physical parameters that
future experimental QEC should target.

### Title: Strategic Signaling for Utility Control in Audit Games

* Summary: As an effective method to protect the daily access to sensitive data against
malicious attacks, the audit mechanism has been widely deployed in various
practical fields. In order to examine security vulnerabilities and prevent the
leakage of sensitive data in a timely manner, the database logging system
usually employs an online signaling scheme to issue an alert when suspicious
access is detected. Defenders can audit alerts to reduce potential damage. This
interaction process between a defender and an attacker can be modeled as an
audit game. In previous studies, it was found that sending real-time signals in
the audit game to warn visitors can improve the benefits of the defender.
However, the previous approaches usually assume perfect information of the
attacker, or simply concentrate on the utility of the defender. In this paper,
we introduce a brand-new zero-determinant (ZD) strategy to study the sequential
audit game with online signaling, which empowers the defender to unilaterally
control the utility of visitors when accessing sensitive data. In addition, an
optimization scheme based on the ZD strategy is designed to effectively
maximize the utility difference between the defender and the attacker.
Extensive simulation results show that our proposed scheme enhances the
security management and control capabilities of the defender to better handle
different access requests and safeguard the system security in a cost-efficient
manner.
