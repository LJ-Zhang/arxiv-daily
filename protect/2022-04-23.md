* Summary: Applications of face recognition systems for authentication purposes are
growing rapidly. Although state-of-the-art (SOTA) face recognition systems have
high recognition performance, the features which are extracted for each user
and are stored in the system's database contain privacy-sensitive information.
Accordingly, compromising this data would jeopardize users' privacy. In this
paper, we propose a new cancelable template protection method, dubbed MLP-hash,
which generates protected templates by passing the extracted features through a
user-specific randomly-weighted multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and binarizing the
MLP output. We evaluated the unlinkability, irreversibility, and recognition
performance of our proposed biometric template protection method to fulfill the
ISO/IEC 30136 standard requirements. Our experiments with SOTA face recognition
systems on the MOBIO and LFW datasets show that our method has competitive
performance with the BioHashing and IoM Hashing (IoM-GRP and IoM-URP) template
protection algorithms. We provide an open-source implementation of all the
experiments presented in this paper so that other researchers can verify our
findings and build upon our work.
