* Summary: Current implementations of quantum bits (qubits) continue to undergo too many
errors to be scaled into useful quantum machines. An emerging strategy is to
encode quantum information in the two meta-stable pointer states of an
oscillator exchanging pairs of photons with its environment, a mechanism shown
to provide stability without inducing decoherence. Adding photons in these
states increases their separation, and macroscopic bit-flip times are expected
even for a handful of photons, a range suitable to implement a qubit. However,
previous experimental realizations have saturated in the millisecond range. In
this work, we aim for the maximum bit-flip time we could achieve in a
two-photon dissipative oscillator. To this end, we design a Josephson circuit
in a regime that circumvents all suspected dynamical instabilities, and employ
a minimally invasive fluorescence detection tool, at the cost of a two-photon
exchange rate dominated by single-photon loss. We attain bit-flip times of the
order of 100 seconds for states pinned by two-photon dissipation and containing
about 40 photons. This experiment lays a solid foundation from which the
two-photon exchange rate can be gradually increased, thus gaining access to the
preparation and measurement of quantum superposition states, and pursuing the
route towards a logical qubit with built-in bit-flip protection.

* Summary: Motivated by the recently synthesized layered material MoSi2N4, we
investigated excitonic response of quasiparticle of monolayer MoSi2N4 by using
G0W0 and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) calculations. With a dually sandwiched
structure consisting of a central MoN2 layer analogue of 2H-MoS2 capped with
silicon-nitrogen (SiN) honeycomb outer layers, MoSi2N4 possesses frontier
orbitals confined at the central MoN2 layer with similar sub-valley at K-point
as 2H-MoS2. The valley splitting (~130 meV) due to the spin-orbital coupling
(SOC) gives rise to a doublet in the spectrum. Excitons in MoSi2N4 shows a
strong binding energy up to 0.95 eV with the optical bandgap of 2.44 eV. Both
electronic and optical gaps are highly sensitive to tensile strains and become
redshift albeit a marginal change of exciton binding energy. With the
protection of capped SiN layers, quantum confined excitons in MoSi2N4 without
the need of additional passivation layer like BN would provide a bright new
platform for robust emission with partially screened disturbance from
environment.

* Summary: Face privacy-preserving is one of the hotspots that arises dramatic interests
of research. However, the existing face privacy-preserving methods aim at
causing the missing of semantic information of face and cannot preserve the
reusability of original facial information. To achieve the naturalness of the
processed face and the recoverability of the original protected face, this
paper proposes face privacy-preserving method based on Invertible "Mask"
Network (IMN). In IMN, we introduce a Mask-net to generate "Mask" face firstly.
Then, put the "Mask" face onto the protected face and generate the masked face,
in which the masked face is indistinguishable from "Mask" face. Finally, "Mask"
face can be put off from the masked face and obtain the recovered face to the
authorized users, in which the recovered face is visually indistinguishable
from the protected face. The experimental results show that the proposed method
can not only effectively protect the privacy of the protected face, but also
almost perfectly recover the protected face from the masked face.

* Summary: Periodic driving may cause topologically protected, chiral transport along
edges of a 2D lattice that, without driving, would be topologically trivial. We
study what happens if one adds a different on-site potential along the diagonal
of such a 2D grid. In addition to the usual bulk and edge states, the system
then also exhibits doublon states, analogous to two interacting particles in
one dimension. A particle initially located at an edge propagates along the
system's boundary. Its wavefunction splits when it hits the diagonal and
continues propagating simultaneously along the edge and the diagonal. The
strength of the diagonal potential determines the ratio between both parts. We
show that for specific values of the diagonal potential, hopping onto the
diagonal is prohibited so that the system effectively separates into two
triangular lattices. For other values of the diagonal potential, we find a
temporal delay between the two contributions traveling around and through the
system. This behavior could enable the steering of topologically protected
transport of light along the edges and through the bulk of laser-inscribed
photonic waveguide arrays.

* Summary: When IP-packet processing is unconditionally carried out on behalf of an
operating system kernel thread, processing systems can experience overload in
high incoming traffic scenarios. This is especially worrying for embedded
real-time devices controlling their physical environment in industrial IoT
scenarios and automotive systems. We propose an embedded real-time aware IP
stack adaption with an early demultiplexing scheme for incoming packets and
subsequent per-flow aperiodic scheduling. By instrumenting existing embedded IP
stacks, rigid prioritization with minimal latency is deployed without the need
of further task resources. Simple mitigation techniques can be applied to
individual flows, causing hardly measurable overhead while at the same time
protecting the system from overload conditions. Our IP stack adaption is able
to reduce the low-priority packet processing time by over 86% compared to an
unmodified stack. The network subsystem can thereby remain active at a 7x
higher general traffic load before disabling the receive IRQ as a last resort
to assure deadlines.

* Summary: The glass transition is considered as a phase transition in the system of
topologically protected excitations in matter structure. The critical behavior
of the system is considered both in statics and dynamics cases. It is shown in
the simple model describing the topological defects system in the elastic
medium with non-zero shear modulus, most of characteristic thermodynamic and
kinetic properties of glass transition are reproduced: the
Vogel--Fulcher--Tammann law; the behavior of susceptibility, and non-linear
susceptibilities; heat capacity behavior; and boson peak near the glass
transition temperature.

* Summary: In the upcoming 6G era, existing terrestrial networks have evolved toward
space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN), providing ultra-high data rates,
seamless network coverage, and ubiquitous intelligence for communications of
applications and services. However, conventional communications in SAGIN still
face data confidentiality issues. Fortunately, the concept of Quantum Key
Distribution (QKD) over SAGIN is able to provide information-theoretic security
for secure communications in SAGIN with quantum cryptography. Therefore, in
this paper, we propose the quantum-secured SAGIN which is feasible to achieve
proven secure communications using quantum mechanics to protect data channels
between space, air, and ground nodes. Moreover, we propose a universal QKD
service provisioning framework to minimize the cost of QKD services under the
uncertainty and dynamics of communications in quantum-secured SAGIN. In this
framework, fiber-based QKD services are deployed in passive optical networks
with the advantages of low loss and high stability. Moreover, the widely
covered and flexible satellite- and UAV-based QKD services are provisioned as a
supplement during the real-time data transmission phase. Finally, to examine
the effectiveness of the proposed concept and framework, a case study of
quantum-secured SAGIN in the Metaverse is conducted where uncertain and dynamic
factors of the secure communications in Metaverse applications are effectively
resolved in the proposed framework.

* Summary: Cryptocurrency has been extensively studied as a decentralized financial
technology built on blockchain. However, there is a lack of understanding of
user experience with cryptocurrency exchanges, the main means for novice users
to interact with cryptocurrency. We conduct a qualitative study to provide a
panoramic view of user experience and security perception of exchanges. All 15
Chinese participants mainly use centralized exchanges (CEX) instead of
decentralized exchanges (DEX) to trade decentralized cryptocurrency, which is
paradoxical. A closer examination reveals that CEXes provide better usability
and charge lower transaction fee than DEXes. Country-specific security
perceptions are observed. Though DEXes provide better anonymity and privacy
protection, and are free of governmental regulation, these are not necessary
features for many participants. Based on the findings, we propose design
implications to make cryptocurrency trading more decentralized.

* Summary: Owing to the specific topological states in nodal-line semimetals, novel
topological superconductivity is expected to emerge in these systems. In this
letter, by combination of the first-principles calculations and resistivity,
susceptibility and specific heat measurements, we demonstrate that
La$_3$Pt$_3$Bi$_4$ is a topologically nontrivial nodal-ring semimetal protected
by the gliding-mirror symmetry even in the presence of spin-orbit coupling.
Meanwhile, we discover bulk superconductivity with a transition temperature of
$\sim$1.1 K, and an upper critical field of $\sim$0.41 T. These findings
demonstrate that La$_3$Pt$_3$Bi$_4$ provides a material platform for studying
novel superconductivity in the nodal-ring system.

* Summary: Imperceptible poisoning attacks on entire datasets have recently been touted
as methods for protecting data privacy. However, among a number of defenses
preventing the practical use of these techniques, early-stopping stands out as
a simple, yet effective defense. To gauge poisons' vulnerability to
early-stopping, we benchmark error-minimizing, error-maximizing, and synthetic
poisons in terms of peak test accuracy over 100 epochs and make a number of
surprising observations. First, we find that poisons that reach a low training
loss faster have lower peak test accuracy. Second, we find that a current
state-of-the-art error-maximizing poison is 7 times less effective when poison
training is stopped at epoch 8. Third, we find that stronger, more transferable
adversarial attacks do not make stronger poisons. We advocate for evaluating
poisons in terms of peak test accuracy.

### Title: Context-Auditor: Context-sensitive Content Injection Mitigation

* Summary: Cross-site scripting (XSS) is the most common vulnerability class in web
applications over the last decade. Much research attention has focused on
building exploit mitigation defenses for this problem, but no technique
provides adequate protection in the face of advanced attacks. One technique
that bypasses XSS mitigations is the scriptless attack: a content injection
technique that uses (among other options) CSS and HTML injection to infiltrate
data. In studying this technique and others, we realized that the common
property among the exploitation of all content injection vulnerabilities,
including not just XSS and scriptless attacks, but also command injections and
several others, is an unintended context switch in the victim program's parsing
engine that is caused by untrusted user input.
  In this paper, we propose Context-Auditor, a novel technique that leverages
this insight to identify content injection vulnerabilities ranging from XSS to
scriptless attacks and command injections. We implemented Context-Auditor as a
general solution to content injection exploit detection problem in the form of
a flexible, stand-alone detection module. We deployed instances of
Context-Auditor as (1) a browser plugin, (2) a web proxy (3) a web server
plugin, and (4) as a wrapper around potentially-injectable system endpoints.
Because Context-Auditor targets the root cause of content injection
exploitation (and, more specifically for the purpose of our prototype, XSS
exploitation, scriptless exploitation, and command injection), our evaluation
results demonstrate that Context-Auditor can identify and block content
injection exploits that modern defenses cannot while maintaining low throughput
overhead and avoiding false positives.
