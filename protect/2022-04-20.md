* Summary: We present Blinded Memory (BliMe), a way to realize efficient and secure
outsourced computation. BliMe consists of a novel and minimal set of ISA
extensions that uses taint tracking to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive
(client) data even in the presence of server malware, run-time attacks, and
side-channel attacks. To secure outsourced computation, the BliMe extensions
can be used together with an attestable, fixed-function trusted execution
environment (TEE) and an encryption engine that provides atomic
decrypt-and-taint and encrypt-and-untaint operations. The TEE engages in an
attestation and key agreement protocol with the client. It provides the
resulting client-specific keys to the encryption engine. Clients rely on remote
attestation to ensure that their data will always be protected by BliMe's taint
tracking policy after decryption. We provide a machine-checked security proof
and an FPGA implementation (BliMe-Ibex) of BliMe's taint tracking policy. We
show that BliMe-Ibex does not reduce performance relative to the unmodified
core, and incurs only minor increases in resource consumption in terms of power
($<2\%$), LUTs ($<1\%$), and registers ($<3\%$).

* Summary: Two-dimensional group III monochalcogenides have recently attracted quite
attention for their wide spectrum of optical and electric properties, being
promising candidates for optoelectronic and novel electrical applications,
however in their pristine form they are very sensitive and vulnerable to oxygen
in air. Here we present two newly designed vdW heterostructures based on hBN
(hexagonal boron nitride) and GaTe or InTe monolayer. Using density functional
theory we investigate electronic and optical properties of those structures.
Their moderate band gap and an good absorption coefficient makes them excellent
for absorbers in wide spectrum, covering all from part of IR to far UV
spectrum, with particularly good absorption of UV light. The hBN layer which
can be beneficial for protection of sensitive GaTe and InTe does not only
preserve their optical properties but also enhances it. Moreover, we confirm
that type of stacking does not affect any relevant properties, as all three
stacking types are very similar in total energy and bandstructure is almost the
same for every one. This is especially important for easier experimental
realization.

* Summary: End-to-end (E2E) models are often being accompanied by language models (LMs)
via shallow fusion for boosting their overall quality as well as recognition of
rare words. At the same time, several prior works show that LMs are susceptible
to unintentionally memorizing rare or unique sequences in the training data. In
this work, we design a framework for detecting memorization of random textual
sequences (which we call canaries) in the LM training data when one has only
black-box (query) access to LM-fused speech recognizer, as opposed to direct
access to the LM. On a production-grade Conformer RNN-T E2E model fused with a
Transformer LM, we show that detecting memorization of singly-occurring
canaries from the LM training data of 300M examples is possible. Motivated to
protect privacy, we also show that such memorization gets significantly reduced
by per-example gradient-clipped LM training without compromising overall
quality.

* Summary: Enhanced coherence in HoW$_{10}$ molecular spin qubits has been demonstrated
by use of Clock Transitions (CTs). More recently it was shown that, while
operating at the CTs, it was possible to use an electrical field to selectively
address HoW$_{10}$ molecules pointing in a given direction, within a crystal
that contains two kinds of identical but inversion-related molecules. Herein we
theoretically explore the possibility of employing the electric field to effect
entangling two-qubit quantum gates among two neighbouring CT-protected
HoW$_{10}$ qubits within a diluted crystal. We estimate the thermal evolution
of $T_1$, $T_2$ and we find that CTs are also optimal operating points from the
point of view of phonons, and that even a moderate cooling from $T=5$K to
$T=3$K would significantly increase coherence times. Provided challenging
initialization requirements are met, it will be possible to combine a sequence
of microwave and electric field pulses to achieve coherent control within a
2-qubit operating space that is protected both from spin-bath and from
phonon-bath decoherence. Finally, we found a highly protected 1-qubit subspace
resulting from the interaction between two clock molecules.

* Code URL: [https://github.com/cuitianyu961030/siamhan](https://github.com/cuitianyu961030/siamhan)
* Summary: Unlike IPv4 addresses, which are typically masked by a NAT, IPv6 addresses
could easily be correlated with user activity, endangering their privacy.
Mitigations to address this privacy concern have been deployed, making existing
approaches for address-to-user correlation unreliable. This work demonstrates
that an adversary could still correlate IPv6 addresses with users accurately,
even with these protection mechanisms. To do this, we propose an IPv6 address
correlation model - SiamHAN. The model uses a Siamese Heterogeneous Graph
Attention Network to measure whether two IPv6 client addresses belong to the
same user even if the user's traffic is protected by TLS encryption. Using a
large real-world dataset, we show that, for the tasks of tracking target users
and discovering unique users, the state-of-the-art techniques could achieve
only 85% and 60% accuracy, respectively. However, SiamHAN exhibits 99% and 88%
accuracy.

* Summary: Future Industrial Internet-of-Things in the upcoming 6G era is expected to
deploy artificial intelligence (AI) and digital twins (DTs) ubiquitously. As a
complement to conventional AI solutions, emergent intelligence (EI) exhibits
various outstanding features including robustness, protection to privacy, and
scalability, which makes it competitive for 6G IIoT applications. However,
despite its low computational complexity, it is challenged by its high demand
of data traffic in massive deployment. In this paper, we propose to exploit the
massive twinning paradigm, which 6G is envisaged to support, to reduce the data
traffic in EI and therewith enhance its performance.

* Summary: For years, Digital Right Management (DRM) systems have been used as the go-to
solution for media content protection against piracy. With the growing
consumption of content using Over-the-Top platforms, such as Netflix or Prime
Video, DRMs have been deployed on numerous devices considered as potential
hostile environments. In this paper, we focus on the most widespread solution,
the closed-source Widevine DRM. Installed on billions of devices, Widevine
relies on cryptographic operations to protect content. Our work presents a
study of Widevine internals on Android, mapping its distinct components and
bringing out its different cryptographic keys involved in content decryption.
We provide a structural view of Widevine as a protocol with its complete key
ladder. Based on our insights, we develop WideXtractor, a tool based on Frida
to trace Widevine function calls and intercept messages for inspection. Using
this tool, we analyze Netflix usage of Widevine as a proof-of-concept, and
raised privacy concerns on user-tracking. In addition, we leverage our
knowledge to bypass the obfuscation of Android Widevine software-only version,
namely L3, and recover its Root-of-Trust.

* Summary: Unlike suggested during their early years of existence, Bitcoin and similar
cryptocurrencies in fact offer significantly less privacy as compared to
traditional banking. A myriad of privacy-enhancing extensions to those
cryptocurrencies as well as several clean-slate privacy-protecting
cryptocurrencies have been proposed in turn. To convey a better understanding
of the protection of popular design decisions, we investigate expected
anonymity set sizes in an initial simulation study. The large variation of
expected transaction values yields soberingly small effective anonymity sets
for protocols that leak transaction values. We hence examine the effect of
preliminary, intuitive strategies for merging groups of payments into larger
anonymity sets, for instance by choosing from pre-specified value classes. The
results hold promise, as they indeed induce larger anonymity sets at
comparatively low cost, depending on the corresponding strategy

* Summary: Quantum information science harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to
realize computational algorithms with complexities vastly intractable by
current computer platforms. Typical applications range from quantum chemistry
to optimization problems and also include simulations for high energy physics.
The recent maturing of quantum hardware has triggered preliminary explorations
by several institutions (including Fermilab) of quantum hardware capable of
demonstrating quantum advantage in multiple domains, from quantum computing to
communications, to sensing. The Superconducting Quantum Materials and Systems
(SQMS) Center, led by Fermilab, is dedicated to providing breakthroughs in
quantum computing and sensing, mediating quantum engineering and HEP based
material science. The main goal of the Center is to deploy quantum systems with
superior performance tailored to the algorithms used in high energy physics. In
this Snowmass paper, we discuss the two most promising superconducting quantum
architectures for HEP algorithms, i.e. three-level systems (qutrits) supported
by transmon devices coupled to planar devices and multi-level systems (qudits
with arbitrary N energy levels) supported by superconducting 3D cavities. For
each architecture, we demonstrate exemplary HEP algorithms and identify the
current challenges, ongoing work and future opportunities. Furthermore, we
discuss the prospects and complexities of interconnecting the different
architectures and individual computational nodes. Finally, we review several
different strategies of error protection and correction and discuss their
potential to improve the performance of the two architectures. This whitepaper
seeks to reach out to the HEP community and drive progress in both HEP research
and QIS hardware.

* Code URL: null
* Summary: The development and the use of quantum technologies are hindered by a
fundamental challenge: Quantum materials exhibit macroscopic quantum properties
at extremely low temperatures due to the loss of quantum coherence at elevated
temperatures. Here, based on our recent discovery of room temperature
superfluorescence in perovskites, we present the Quantum Analog of Vibration
Isolation, 'QAVI', model and explain how it protects the quantum phase against
dephasing at high temperatures. We then postulate the requirements for
observation of macroscopic quantum phenomena at practical temperatures and
propose a unified model for all macroscopic quantum phase transitions. We
further present the general features of the temperature and density phase
diagram of macroscopic quantum phase transitions that are mediated by the QAVI
process and identify the similarities observed in the phase diagram of high Tc
superconductors. Understanding this fundamental quantum coherence protection
mechanism is imperative to accelerate the discovery of high temperature
macroscopic quantum phenomena, and offers significant potential for developing
quantum technologies functioning under practical conditions.

* Code URL: [https://github.com/edisonleeeee/guard](https://github.com/edisonleeeee/guard)
* Summary: Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have shown to be vulnerable to
small adversarial perturbations, which becomes a severe threat and largely
limits their applications in security-critical scenarios. To mitigate such a
threat, considerable research efforts have been devoted to increasing the
robustness of GCNs against adversarial attacks. However, current approaches for
defense are typically designed for the whole graph and consider the global
performance, posing challenges in protecting important local nodes from
stronger adversarial targeted attacks. In this work, we present a simple yet
effective method, named \textbf{\underline{G}}raph
\textbf{\underline{U}}niversal
\textbf{\underline{A}}dve\textbf{\underline{R}}sarial
\textbf{\underline{D}}efense (GUARD). Unlike previous works, GUARD protects
each individual node from attacks with a universal defensive patch, which is
generated once and can be applied to any node (node-agnostic) in a graph.
Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly improves robustness for several established GCNs against multiple
adversarial attacks and outperforms existing adversarial defense methods by
large margins. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/EdisonLeeeee/GUARD.
