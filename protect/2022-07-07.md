* Summary: Cyber risk assessment is a fundamental activity for enhancing the protection
of an organization, identifying and evaluating the exposure to cyber threats.
Currently, this activity is carried out mainly manually and the identification
and correct quantification of risks deeply depend on the experience and
confidence of the human assessor. As a consequence, the process is not
completely objective and two parallel assessments of the same situation may
lead to different results. This paper takes a step in the direction of reducing
the degree of subjectivity by proposing a methodology to support risk assessors
with an automatic review of the produced assessment. Our methodology starts
from a controls-based assessment performed using well-known cybersecurity
frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST) and maps security controls over
infrastructural aspects that can be assessed automatically (e.g., ICT devices,
organization policies). Exploiting this mapping, the methodology suggests how
to identify controls needing revision. The approach has been validated through
a case study from the healthcare domain and a set of statistical analyses.
