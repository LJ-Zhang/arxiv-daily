* Summary: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has produced great achievements since it
was proposed, including the possibility of processing raw vision input data.
However, training an agent to perform tasks based on image feedback remains a
challenge. It requires the processing of large amounts of data from
high-dimensional observation spaces, frame by frame, and the agent's actions
are computed according to deep neural network policies, end-to-end. Image
pre-processing is an effective way of reducing these high dimensional spaces,
eliminating unnecessary information present in the scene, supporting the
extraction of features and their representations in the agent's neural network.
Modern video-games are examples of this type of challenge for DRL algorithms
because of their visual complexity. In this paper, we propose a low-dimensional
observation filter that allows a deep Q-network agent to successfully play in a
visually complex and modern video-game, called Neon Drive.

### Title: Casimir Self-Entropy of Nanoparticles with Classical Polarizabilities: Electromagnetic Field Fluctuations

* Summary: Not only are Casimir interaction entropies not guaranteed to be positive, but
also, more strikingly, Casimir self-entropies of bodies can be negative. Here,
we attempt to interpret the physical origin and meaning of these negative
self-entropies by investigating the Casimir self-entropy of a neutral spherical
nanoparticle. After extracting the polarizabilities of such a particle by
examining the asymptotic behavior of the scattering Green's function, we
compute the corresponding free energy and entropy. Two models for the
nanoparticle, namely a spherical plasma $\delta$-function shell and a
homogeneous dielectric/diamagnetic ball, are considered at low temperature,
because that is all that can be revealed from a nanoparticle perspective. The
second model includes a contribution to the entropy from the bulk free energy,
referring to the situation where the medium inside or outside the ball fills
all space, which must be subtracted on physical grounds in order to maintain
consistency with van der Waals interactions, corresponding to the self-entropy
of each bulk. (The van der Waals calculation is described in Appendix A.) The
entropies so calculated agree with known results in the low-temperature limit,
appropriate for a small particle, and are negative. But we suggest that the
negative self-entropy is simply an interaction entropy, the difference between
the total entropy and the blackbody entropy of the two bulks, outside or inside
of the nanosphere. The vacuum entropy is always positive and overwhelms the
interaction entropy. Thus the interaction entropy can be negative, without
contradicting the principles of statistical thermodynamics. Because the entropy
of blackbody radiation by itself plays an important role, it is also discussed,
including dispersive effects, in detail.

* Summary: We study constructively the relations between the finite cases of Dickson's
lemma. Although there are many constructive proofs of them, the novel aspect of
our proofs is the extraction of a corresponding bound. We provide some new
one-step unprovability results i.e., results of the form "a finite case of
Dickson's lemma does not prove in one step a stronger case of it". Moreover, we
study the infinite cases of Dickson's lemma from the point of view of
constructive reverse mathematics. We work within Bishop's informal system of
constructive mathematics BISH.

### Title: 2D LiDAR and Camera Fusion Using Motion Cues for Indoor Layout Estimation

* Code URL: [https://github.com/leejieyu13/lidarcameradataset](https://github.com/leejieyu13/lidarcameradataset)
* Summary: This paper presents a novel indoor layout estimation system based on the
fusion of 2D LiDAR and intensity camera data. A ground robot explores an indoor
space with a single floor and vertical walls, and collects a sequence of
intensity images and 2D LiDAR datasets. The LiDAR provides accurate depth
information, while the camera captures high-resolution data for semantic
interpretation. The alignment of sensor outputs and image segmentation are
computed jointly by aligning LiDAR points, as samples of the room contour, to
ground-wall boundaries in the images. The alignment problem is decoupled into a
top-down view projection and a 2D similarity transformation estimation, which
can be solved according to the vertical vanishing point and motion of two
sensors. The recursive random sample consensus algorithm is implemented to
generate, evaluate and optimize multiple hypotheses with the sequential
measurements. The system allows jointly analyzing the geometric interpretation
from different sensors without offline calibration. The ambiguity in images for
ground-wall boundary extraction is removed with the assistance of LiDAR
observations, which improves the accuracy of semantic segmentation. The
localization and mapping is refined using the fused data, which enables the
system to work reliably in scenes with low texture or low geometric features.

* Summary: Although few-shot learning has attracted much attention from the fields of
image and audio classification, few efforts have been made on few-shot speaker
identification. In the task of few-shot learning, overfitting is a tough
problem mainly due to the mismatch between training and testing conditions. In
this paper, we propose a few-shot speaker identification method which can
alleviate the overfitting problem. In the proposed method, the model of a
depthwise separable convolutional network with channel attention is trained
with a prototypical loss function. Experimental datasets are extracted from
three public speech corpora: Aishell-2, VoxCeleb1 and TORGO. Experimental
results show that the proposed method exceeds state-of-the-art methods for
few-shot speaker identification in terms of accuracy and F-score.

### Title: Quasinormal modes of black holes in f(T) gravity

* Summary: We calculate the quasinormal modes (QNM) frequencies of a test massless
scalar field around static black holes in f(T) gravity. Focusing on quadratic
f(T) modifications, which is a good approximation for every realistic f(T)
theory, we first extract the spherically symmetric solutions using the
perturbative method, imposing two ansatze for the metric functions, which
suitably quantify the deviation from the Schwarzschild solution. Moreover, we
extract the effective potential and then we calculate the QNM frequency of the
obtained solutions. Firstly, we solve the Schrodinger-like equation numerically
using the discretization method, and we extract the frequency and the time
evolution of the dominant mode applying the function fit method. Secondly, we
perform a semi-analytical calculation by applying the third-order WKB
approximation method. We show that the results for f(T) gravity are different
comparing to General Relativity, and in particular we obtain a different slope
and period of the field decay behavior for different values of the model
parameter. Hence, under the light of gravitational-wave observations of
increasing accuracy from binary systems, the whole analysis could be used as an
additional tool in order to test General Relativity and examine whether
torsional gravitational modifications are possible.

* Summary: Risk assessment is a substantial problem for financial institutions that has
been extensively studied both for its methodological richness and its various
practical applications. With the expansion of inclusive finance, recent
attentions are paid to micro and small-sized enterprises (MSEs). Compared with
large companies, MSEs present a higher exposure rate to default owing to their
insecure financial stability. Conventional efforts learn classifiers from
historical data with elaborate feature engineering. However, the main obstacle
for MSEs involves severe deficiency in credit-related information, which may
degrade the performance of prediction. Besides, financial activities have
diverse explicit and implicit relations, which have not been fully exploited
for risk judgement in commercial banks. In particular, the observations on real
data show that various relationships between company users have additional
power in financial risk analysis. In this paper, we consider a graph of banking
data, and propose a novel HIDAM model for the purpose. Specifically, we attempt
to incorporate heterogeneous information network with rich attributes on
multi-typed nodes and links for modeling the scenario of business banking
service. To enhance feature representation of MSEs, we extract interactive
information through meta-paths and fully exploit path information. Furthermore,
we devise a hierarchical attention mechanism respectively to learn the
importance of contents inside each meta-path and the importance of different
metapahs. Experimental results verify that HIDAM outperforms state-of-the-art
competitors on real-world banking data.
