* Summary: A growing line of work has investigated the development of neural NLP models
that can produce rationales--subsets of input that can explain their model
predictions. In this paper, we ask whether such rationale models can also
provide robustness to adversarial attacks in addition to their interpretable
nature. Since these models need to first generate rationales ("rationalizer")
before making predictions ("predictor"), they have the potential to ignore
noise or adversarially added text by simply masking it out of the generated
rationale. To this end, we systematically generate various types of 'AddText'
attacks for both token and sentence-level rationalization tasks, and perform an
extensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art rationale models across five
different tasks. Our experiments reveal that the rationale models show the
promise to improve robustness, while they struggle in certain scenarios--when
the rationalizer is sensitive to positional bias or lexical choices of attack
text. Further, leveraging human rationale as supervision does not always
translate to better performance. Our study is a first step towards exploring
the interplay between interpretability and robustness in the
rationalize-then-predict framework.

* Summary: CySecTool is a tool that finds a cost-optimal security controls portfolio in
a given budget for a probabilistic attack graph. A portfolio is a set of
counter-measures, or controls, against vulnerabilities adopted for a computer
system, while an attack graph is a type of a threat scenario model. In an
attack graph, nodes are privilege states of the attacker, edges are
vulnerabilities escalating privileges, and controls reduce the probabilities of
some vulnerabilities being exploited. The tool builds on an optimisation
algorithm published by Khouzani et al. (2019), enabling a user to quickly
create, edit, and incrementally improve models, analyse results for given
portfolios and display the best solutions for all possible budgets in the form
of a Pareto frontier. A case study was performed utilising a system graph and
suspected attack paths prepared by industrial security engineers based on an
industrial source with which they work. The goal of the case study is to model
a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) industrial system which, due
to having the potential to harm people, necessitates strong protection while
not allowing the use of typical penetration tools like vulnerability scanners.
Results are analysed to show how a cyber-security analyst would use CySecTool
to store cyber-security intelligence and draw further conclusions.

* Summary: In this paper we present a feedback approach to the design of an attack
mitigation policy for DAG-based Distributed Ledgers. We develop a model to
analyse the behaviour of the ledger under the so called Tips Inflation Attack
and we design a control strategy to counteract this attack strategy. The
efficacy of this approach is showcased through a theoretical analysis, in the
form of two theorems about the stability properties of the ledger with and
without the controller, and extensive Monte Carlo simulations of an agent-based
model of the distributed ledger.

### Title: Cryptography Is Not Enough: Relay Attacks on Authenticated GNSS Signals

* Code URL: null
* Summary: Civilian-GNSS is vulnerable to signal spoofing attacks, and countermeasures
based on cryptographic authentication are being proposed to protect against
these attacks. Both Galileo and GPS are currently testing broadcast
authentication techniques based on the delayed key disclosure to validate the
integrity of navigation messages. These authentication mechanisms have proven
secure against record now and replay later attacks, as navigation messages
become invalid after keys are released. This work analyzes the security
guarantees of cryptographically protected GNSS signals and shows the
possibility of spoofing a receiver to an arbitrary location without breaking
any cryptographic operation. In contrast to prior work, we demonstrate the
ability of an attacker to receive signals close to the victim receiver and
generate spoofing signals for a different target location without modifying the
navigation message contents. Our strategy exploits the essential common
reception and transmission time method used to estimate pseudorange in GNSS
receivers, thereby rendering any cryptographic authentication useless. We
evaluate our attack on a commercial receiver (ublox M9N) and a software-defined
GNSS receiver (GNSS-SDR) using a combination of open-source tools, commercial
GNSS signal generators, and software-defined radio hardware platforms. Our
results show that it is possible to spoof a victim receiver to locations around
4000 km away from the true location without requiring any high-speed
communication networks or modifying the message contents. Through this work, we
further highlight the fundamental limitations in securing a broadcast
signaling-based localization system even if all communications are
cryptographically protected.

* Summary: As deep learning applications, especially programs of computer vision, are
increasingly deployed in our lives, we have to think more urgently about the
security of these applications.One effective way to improve the security of
deep learning models is to perform adversarial training, which allows the model
to be compatible with samples that are deliberately created for use in
attacking the model.Based on this, we propose a simple architecture to build a
model with a certain degree of robustness, which improves the robustness of the
trained network by adding an adversarial sample detection network for
cooperative training.At the same time, we design a new data sampling strategy
that incorporates multiple existing attacks, allowing the model to adapt to
many different adversarial attacks with a single training.We conducted some
experiments to test the effectiveness of this design based on Cifar10 dataset,
and the results indicate that it has some degree of positive effect on the
robustness of the model.Our code could be found at

### Title: Mitigation of Cyberattacks through Battery Storage for Stable Microgrid Operation

* Code URL: null
* Summary: In this paper, we present a mitigation methodology that leverages battery
energy storage system (BESS) resources in coordination with microgrid (MG)
ancillary services to maintain power system operations during cyberattacks. The
control of MG agents is achieved in a distributed fashion, and once a
misbehaving agent is detected, the MG's mode supervisory controller (MSC)
isolates the compromised agent and initiates self-healing procedures to support
the power demand and restore the compromised agent. Our results demonstrate the
practicality of the proposed attack mitigation strategy and how grid resilience
can be improved using BESS synergies. Simulations are performed on a modified
version of the Canadian urban benchmark distribution model.

* Summary: Visual object tracking is an important task in computer vision, which has
many real-world applications, e.g., video surveillance, visual navigation.
Visual object tracking also has many challenges, e.g., object occlusion and
deformation. To solve above problems and track the target accurately and
efficiently, many tracking algorithms have emerged in recent years. This paper
presents the rationale and representative works of two most popular tracking
frameworks in past ten years, i.e., the corelation filter and Siamese network
for object tracking. Then we present some deep learning based tracking methods
categorized by different network structures. We also introduce some classical
strategies for handling the challenges in tracking problem. Further, this paper
detailedly present and compare the benchmarks and challenges for tracking, from
which we summarize the development history and development trend of visual
tracking. Focusing on the future development of object tracking, which we think
would be applied in real-world scenes before some problems to be addressed,
such as the problems in long-term tracking, low-power high-speed tracking and
attack-robust tracking. In the future, the integration of multimodal data,
e.g., the depth image, thermal image with traditional color image, will provide
more solutions for visual tracking. Moreover, tracking task will go together
with some other tasks, e.g., video object detection and segmentation.

### Title: Strategic Signaling for Utility Control in Audit Games

* Summary: As an effective method to protect the daily access to sensitive data against
malicious attacks, the audit mechanism has been widely deployed in various
practical fields. In order to examine security vulnerabilities and prevent the
leakage of sensitive data in a timely manner, the database logging system
usually employs an online signaling scheme to issue an alert when suspicious
access is detected. Defenders can audit alerts to reduce potential damage. This
interaction process between a defender and an attacker can be modeled as an
audit game. In previous studies, it was found that sending real-time signals in
the audit game to warn visitors can improve the benefits of the defender.
However, the previous approaches usually assume perfect information of the
attacker, or simply concentrate on the utility of the defender. In this paper,
we introduce a brand-new zero-determinant (ZD) strategy to study the sequential
audit game with online signaling, which empowers the defender to unilaterally
control the utility of visitors when accessing sensitive data. In addition, an
optimization scheme based on the ZD strategy is designed to effectively
maximize the utility difference between the defender and the attacker.
Extensive simulation results show that our proposed scheme enhances the
security management and control capabilities of the defender to better handle
different access requests and safeguard the system security in a cost-efficient
manner.

### Title: Real or Virtual: A Video Conferencing Background Manipulation-Detection System
* Paper ID: 2204.11853v1
* Paper URL: [http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11853v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11853v1)

* Summary: Recently, the popularity and wide use of the last-generation video
conferencing technologies created an exponential growth in its market size.
Such technology allows participants in different geographic regions to have a
virtual face-to-face meeting. Additionally, it enables users to employ a
virtual background to conceal their own environment due to privacy concerns or
to reduce distractions, particularly in professional settings. Nevertheless, in
scenarios where the users should not hide their actual locations, they may
mislead other participants by claiming their virtual background as a real one.
Therefore, it is crucial to develop tools and strategies to detect the
authenticity of the considered virtual background. In this paper, we present a
detection strategy to distinguish between real and virtual video conferencing
user backgrounds. We demonstrate that our detector is robust against two attack
scenarios. The first scenario considers the case where the detector is unaware
about the attacks and inn the second scenario, we make the detector aware of
the adversarial attacks, which we refer to Adversarial Multimedia Forensics
(i.e, the forensically-edited frames are included in the training set). Given
the lack of publicly available dataset of virtual and real backgrounds for
video conferencing, we created our own dataset and made them publicly available
[1]. Then, we demonstrate the robustness of our detector against different
adversarial attacks that the adversary considers. Ultimately, our detector's
performance is significant against the CRSPAM1372 [2] features, and
post-processing operations such as geometric transformations with different
quality factors that the attacker may choose. Moreover, our performance results
shows that we can perfectly identify a real from a virtual background with an
accuracy of 99.80%.
