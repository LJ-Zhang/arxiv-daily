* Summary: End-to-end (E2E) models are often being accompanied by language models (LMs)
via shallow fusion for boosting their overall quality as well as recognition of
rare words. At the same time, several prior works show that LMs are susceptible
to unintentionally memorizing rare or unique sequences in the training data. In
this work, we design a framework for detecting memorization of random textual
sequences (which we call canaries) in the LM training data when one has only
black-box (query) access to LM-fused speech recognizer, as opposed to direct
access to the LM. On a production-grade Conformer RNN-T E2E model fused with a
Transformer LM, we show that detecting memorization of singly-occurring
canaries from the LM training data of 300M examples is possible. Motivated to
protect privacy, we also show that such memorization gets significantly reduced
by per-example gradient-clipped LM training without compromising overall
quality.

* Summary: Since the lack of IPv6 network development, China is currently accelerating
IPv6 deployment. In this scenario, traffic and network structure show a huge
shift. However, due to the long-term prosperity, we are ignorant of the
problems behind such outbreak of traffic and performance improvement events in
accelerating deployment. IPv6 development in some regions will still face
similar challenges in the future. To contribute to solving this problem, in
this paper, we produce a new measurement framework and implement a 5-month
passive measurement on the IPv6 network during the accelerating deployment in
China. We combine 6 global-scale datasets to form the normal status of IPv6
network, which is against to the accelerating status formed by the passive
traffic. Moreover, we compare with the traffic during World IPv6 Day 2011 and
Launch 2012 to discuss the common nature of accelerating deployment. Finally,
the results indicate that the IPv6 accelerating deployment is often accompanied
by an unbalanced network status. It exposes unresolved security issues
including the challenge of user privacy and inappropriate access methods.
According to the investigation, we point the future IPv6 development after
accelerating deployment.

### Title: SiamHAN: IPv6 Address Correlation Attacks on TLS Encrypted Traffic via Siamese Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network

* Code URL: [https://github.com/cuitianyu961030/siamhan](https://github.com/cuitianyu961030/siamhan)
* Summary: Unlike IPv4 addresses, which are typically masked by a NAT, IPv6 addresses
could easily be correlated with user activity, endangering their privacy.
Mitigations to address this privacy concern have been deployed, making existing
approaches for address-to-user correlation unreliable. This work demonstrates
that an adversary could still correlate IPv6 addresses with users accurately,
even with these protection mechanisms. To do this, we propose an IPv6 address
correlation model - SiamHAN. The model uses a Siamese Heterogeneous Graph
Attention Network to measure whether two IPv6 client addresses belong to the
same user even if the user's traffic is protected by TLS encryption. Using a
large real-world dataset, we show that, for the tasks of tracking target users
and discovering unique users, the state-of-the-art techniques could achieve
only 85% and 60% accuracy, respectively. However, SiamHAN exhibits 99% and 88%
accuracy.

* Summary: Large scale adoption of large language models has introduced a new era of
convenient knowledge transfer for a slew of natural language processing tasks.
However, these models also run the risk of undermining user trust by exposing
unwanted information about the data subjects, which may be extracted by a
malicious party, e.g. through adversarial attacks. We present an empirical
investigation into the extent of the personal information encoded into
pre-trained representations by a range of popular models, and we show a
positive correlation between the complexity of a model, the amount of data used
in pre-training, and data leakage. In this paper, we present the first wide
coverage evaluation and comparison of some of the most popular
privacy-preserving algorithms, on a large, multi-lingual dataset on sentiment
analysis annotated with demographic information (location, age and gender). The
results show since larger and more complex models are more prone to leaking
private information, use of privacy-preserving methods is highly desirable. We
also find that highly privacy-preserving technologies like differential privacy
(DP) can have serious model utility effects, which can be ameliorated using
hybrid or metric-DP techniques.

* Summary: Federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a method to train a model on
different units without exchanging data. This offers great opportunities in the
healthcare sector, where large datasets are available but cannot be shared to
ensure patient privacy. We systematically investigate the effectiveness of FL
on the publicly available eICU dataset for predicting the survival of each ICU
stay. We employ Federated Averaging as the main practical algorithm for FL and
show how its performance changes by altering three key hyper-parameters, taking
into account that clients can significantly vary in size. We find that in many
settings, a large number of local training epochs improves the performance
while at the same time reducing communication costs. Furthermore, we outline in
which settings it is possible to have only a low number of hospitals
participating in each federated update round. When many hospitals with low
patient counts are involved, the effect of overfitting can be avoided by
decreasing the batchsize. This study thus contributes toward identifying
suitable settings for running distributed algorithms such as FL on clinical
datasets.

* Summary: Future Industrial Internet-of-Things in the upcoming 6G era is expected to
deploy artificial intelligence (AI) and digital twins (DTs) ubiquitously. As a
complement to conventional AI solutions, emergent intelligence (EI) exhibits
various outstanding features including robustness, protection to privacy, and
scalability, which makes it competitive for 6G IIoT applications. However,
despite its low computational complexity, it is challenged by its high demand
of data traffic in massive deployment. In this paper, we propose to exploit the
massive twinning paradigm, which 6G is envisaged to support, to reduce the data
traffic in EI and therewith enhance its performance.

* Summary: For years, Digital Right Management (DRM) systems have been used as the go-to
solution for media content protection against piracy. With the growing
consumption of content using Over-the-Top platforms, such as Netflix or Prime
Video, DRMs have been deployed on numerous devices considered as potential
hostile environments. In this paper, we focus on the most widespread solution,
the closed-source Widevine DRM. Installed on billions of devices, Widevine
relies on cryptographic operations to protect content. Our work presents a
study of Widevine internals on Android, mapping its distinct components and
bringing out its different cryptographic keys involved in content decryption.
We provide a structural view of Widevine as a protocol with its complete key
ladder. Based on our insights, we develop WideXtractor, a tool based on Frida
to trace Widevine function calls and intercept messages for inspection. Using
this tool, we analyze Netflix usage of Widevine as a proof-of-concept, and
raised privacy concerns on user-tracking. In addition, we leverage our
knowledge to bypass the obfuscation of Android Widevine software-only version,
namely L3, and recover its Root-of-Trust.

* Summary: Unlike suggested during their early years of existence, Bitcoin and similar
cryptocurrencies in fact offer significantly less privacy as compared to
traditional banking. A myriad of privacy-enhancing extensions to those
cryptocurrencies as well as several clean-slate privacy-protecting
cryptocurrencies have been proposed in turn. To convey a better understanding
of the protection of popular design decisions, we investigate expected
anonymity set sizes in an initial simulation study. The large variation of
expected transaction values yields soberingly small effective anonymity sets
for protocols that leak transaction values. We hence examine the effect of
preliminary, intuitive strategies for merging groups of payments into larger
anonymity sets, for instance by choosing from pre-specified value classes. The
results hold promise, as they indeed induce larger anonymity sets at
comparatively low cost, depending on the corresponding strategy

* Summary: Differential privacy is a mathematical concept that provides an
information-theoretic security guarantee. While differential privacy has
emerged as a de facto standard for guaranteeing privacy in data sharing, the
known mechanisms to achieve it come with some serious limitations. Utility
guarantees are usually provided only for a fixed, a priori specified set of
queries. Moreover, there are no utility guarantees for more complex - but very
common - machine learning tasks such as clustering or classification. In this
paper we overcome some of these limitations. Working with metric privacy, a
powerful generalization of differential privacy, we develop a polynomial-time
algorithm that creates a private measure from a data set. This private measure
allows us to efficiently construct private synthetic data that are accurate for
a wide range of statistical analysis tools. Moreover, we prove an
asymptotically sharp min-max result for private measures and synthetic data for
general compact metric spaces. A key ingredient in our construction is a new
superregular random walk, whose joint distribution of steps is as regular as
that of independent random variables, yet which deviates from the origin
logarithmicaly slowly.

* Summary: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt
the normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network by overwhelming the
target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic.
Emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things and Software Defined
Networking leverage lightweight strategies for the early detection of DDoS
attacks. Previous literature demonstrates the utility of lower number of
significant features for intrusion detection. Thus, it is essential to have a
fast and effective security identification model based on low number of
features.
  In this work, a novel Attention-based Isolation Forest Intrusion Detection
System is proposed. The model considerably reduces training time and memory
consumption of the generated model. For performance assessment, the model is
assessed over two benchmark datasets, the NSL-KDD dataset & the KDDCUP'99
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed attention augmented
model achieves a significant reduction in execution time, by 91.78%, and an
average detection F1-Score of 0.93 on the NSL-KDD and KDDCUP'99 dataset. The
results of performance evaluation show that the proposed methodology has low
complexity and requires less processing time and computational resources,
outperforming other current IDS based on machine learning algorithms.

* Summary: The majority of IoT devices like smartwatches, smart plugs, HVAC controllers,
etc., are powered by hardware with a constrained specification (low memory,
clock speed and processor) which is insufficient to accommodate and execute
large, high-quality models. On such resource-constrained devices, manufacturers
still manage to provide attractive functionalities (to boost sales) by
following the traditional approach of programming IoT devices/products to
collect and transmit data (image, audio, sensor readings, etc.) to their
cloud-based ML analytics platforms. For decades, this online approach has been
facing issues such as compromised data streams, non-real-time analytics due to
latency, bandwidth constraints, costly subscriptions, recent privacy issues
raised by users and the GDPR guidelines, etc. In this paper, to enable
ultra-fast and accurate AI-based offline analytics on resource-constrained IoT
devices, we present an end-to-end multi-component model optimization sequence
and open-source its implementation. Researchers and developers can use our
optimization sequence to optimize high memory, computation demanding models in
multiple aspects in order to produce small size, low latency, low-power
consuming models that can comfortably fit and execute on resource-constrained
hardware. The experimental results show that our optimization components can
produce models that are; (i) 12.06 x times compressed; (ii) 0.13% to 0.27% more
accurate; (iii) Orders of magnitude faster unit inference at 0.06 ms. Our
optimization sequence is generic and can be applied to any state-of-the-art
models trained for anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, robotics, voice
recognition, and machine vision.

the results indicate that the IPv6 accelerating deployment is often accompanied
by an unbalanced network status. It exposes unresolved security issues
including the challenge of user privacy and inappropriate access methods.
According to the investigation, we point the future IPv6 development after
accelerating deployment.

### Title: SiamHAN: IPv6 Address Correlation Attacks on TLS Encrypted Traffic via Siamese Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network

* Summary: Unlike IPv4 addresses, which are typically masked by a NAT, IPv6 addresses
could easily be correlated with user activity, endangering their privacy.
Mitigations to address this privacy concern have been deployed, making existing
approaches for address-to-user correlation unreliable. This work demonstrates
that an adversary could still correlate IPv6 addresses with users accurately,
even with these protection mechanisms. To do this, we propose an IPv6 address
correlation model - SiamHAN. The model uses a Siamese Heterogeneous Graph
Attention Network to measure whether two IPv6 client addresses belong to the
same user even if the user's traffic is protected by TLS encryption. Using a
large real-world dataset, we show that, for the tasks of tracking target users
and discovering unique users, the state-of-the-art techniques could achieve
only 85% and 60% accuracy, respectively. However, SiamHAN exhibits 99% and 88%
accuracy.

* Summary: The majority of IoT devices like smartwatches, smart plugs, HVAC controllers,
etc., are powered by hardware with a constrained specification (low memory,
clock speed and processor) which is insufficient to accommodate and execute
large, high-quality models. On such resource-constrained devices, manufacturers
still manage to provide attractive functionalities (to boost sales) by
following the traditional approach of programming IoT devices/products to
collect and transmit data (image, audio, sensor readings, etc.) to their
cloud-based ML analytics platforms. For decades, this online approach has been
facing issues such as compromised data streams, non-real-time analytics due to
latency, bandwidth constraints, costly subscriptions, recent privacy issues
raised by users and the GDPR guidelines, etc. In this paper, to enable
ultra-fast and accurate AI-based offline analytics on resource-constrained IoT
devices, we present an end-to-end multi-component model optimization sequence
and open-source its implementation. Researchers and developers can use our
optimization sequence to optimize high memory, computation demanding models in
multiple aspects in order to produce small size, low latency, low-power
consuming models that can comfortably fit and execute on resource-constrained
hardware. The experimental results show that our optimization components can
produce models that are; (i) 12.06 x times compressed; (ii) 0.13% to 0.27% more
accurate; (iii) Orders of magnitude faster unit inference at 0.06 ms. Our
optimization sequence is generic and can be applied to any state-of-the-art
models trained for anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, robotics, voice
recognition, and machine vision.

* Summary: Large scale adoption of large language models has introduced a new era of
convenient knowledge transfer for a slew of natural language processing tasks.
However, these models also run the risk of undermining user trust by exposing
unwanted information about the data subjects, which may be extracted by a
malicious party, e.g. through adversarial attacks. We present an empirical
investigation into the extent of the personal information encoded into
pre-trained representations by a range of popular models, and we show a
positive correlation between the complexity of a model, the amount of data used
in pre-training, and data leakage. In this paper, we present the first wide
coverage evaluation and comparison of some of the most popular
privacy-preserving algorithms, on a large, multi-lingual dataset on sentiment
analysis annotated with demographic information (location, age and gender). The
results show since larger and more complex models are more prone to leaking
private information, use of privacy-preserving methods is highly desirable. We
also find that highly privacy-preserving technologies like differential privacy
(DP) can have serious model utility effects, which can be ameliorated using
hybrid or metric-DP techniques.

### Title: Federated Learning in Multi-Center Critical Care Research: A Systematic Case Study using the eICU Database

* Summary: Federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a method to train a model on
different units without exchanging data. This offers great opportunities in the
healthcare sector, where large datasets are available but cannot be shared to
ensure patient privacy. We systematically investigate the effectiveness of FL
on the publicly available eICU dataset for predicting the survival of each ICU
stay. We employ Federated Averaging as the main practical algorithm for FL and
show how its performance changes by altering three key hyper-parameters, taking
into account that clients can significantly vary in size. We find that in many
settings, a large number of local training epochs improves the performance
while at the same time reducing communication costs. Furthermore, we outline in
which settings it is possible to have only a low number of hospitals
participating in each federated update round. When many hospitals with low
patient counts are involved, the effect of overfitting can be avoided by
decreasing the batchsize. This study thus contributes toward identifying
suitable settings for running distributed algorithms such as FL on clinical
datasets.

* Summary: Future Industrial Internet-of-Things in the upcoming 6G era is expected to
deploy artificial intelligence (AI) and digital twins (DTs) ubiquitously. As a
complement to conventional AI solutions, emergent intelligence (EI) exhibits
various outstanding features including robustness, protection to privacy, and
scalability, which makes it competitive for 6G IIoT applications. However,
despite its low computational complexity, it is challenged by its high demand
of data traffic in massive deployment. In this paper, we propose to exploit the
massive twinning paradigm, which 6G is envisaged to support, to reduce the data
traffic in EI and therewith enhance its performance.

* Summary: For years, Digital Right Management (DRM) systems have been used as the go-to
solution for media content protection against piracy. With the growing
consumption of content using Over-the-Top platforms, such as Netflix or Prime
Video, DRMs have been deployed on numerous devices considered as potential
hostile environments. In this paper, we focus on the most widespread solution,
the closed-source Widevine DRM. Installed on billions of devices, Widevine
relies on cryptographic operations to protect content. Our work presents a
study of Widevine internals on Android, mapping its distinct components and
bringing out its different cryptographic keys involved in content decryption.
We provide a structural view of Widevine as a protocol with its complete key
ladder. Based on our insights, we develop WideXtractor, a tool based on Frida
to trace Widevine function calls and intercept messages for inspection. Using
this tool, we analyze Netflix usage of Widevine as a proof-of-concept, and
raised privacy concerns on user-tracking. In addition, we leverage our
knowledge to bypass the obfuscation of Android Widevine software-only version,
namely L3, and recover its Root-of-Trust.

* Summary: Unlike suggested during their early years of existence, Bitcoin and similar
cryptocurrencies in fact offer significantly less privacy as compared to
traditional banking. A myriad of privacy-enhancing extensions to those
cryptocurrencies as well as several clean-slate privacy-protecting
cryptocurrencies have been proposed in turn. To convey a better understanding
of the protection of popular design decisions, we investigate expected
anonymity set sizes in an initial simulation study. The large variation of
expected transaction values yields soberingly small effective anonymity sets
for protocols that leak transaction values. We hence examine the effect of
preliminary, intuitive strategies for merging groups of payments into larger
anonymity sets, for instance by choosing from pre-specified value classes. The
results hold promise, as they indeed induce larger anonymity sets at
comparatively low cost, depending on the corresponding strategy

* Summary: Differential privacy is a mathematical concept that provides an
information-theoretic security guarantee. While differential privacy has
emerged as a de facto standard for guaranteeing privacy in data sharing, the
known mechanisms to achieve it come with some serious limitations. Utility
guarantees are usually provided only for a fixed, a priori specified set of
queries. Moreover, there are no utility guarantees for more complex - but very
common - machine learning tasks such as clustering or classification. In this
paper we overcome some of these limitations. Working with metric privacy, a
powerful generalization of differential privacy, we develop a polynomial-time
algorithm that creates a private measure from a data set. This private measure
allows us to efficiently construct private synthetic data that are accurate for
a wide range of statistical analysis tools. Moreover, we prove an
asymptotically sharp min-max result for private measures and synthetic data for
general compact metric spaces. A key ingredient in our construction is a new
superregular random walk, whose joint distribution of steps is as regular as
that of independent random variables, yet which deviates from the origin
logarithmicaly slowly.
