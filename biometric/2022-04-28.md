* Summary: In security systems the risk assessment in the sense of common criteria
testing is a very relevant topic; this requires quantifying the attack
potential in terms of the expertise of the attacker, his knowledge about the
target and access to equipment. Contrary to those attacks, the recently
revealed morphing attacks against Face Recognition Systems (FRSs) can not be
assessed by any of the above criteria. But not all morphing techniques pose the
same risk for an operational face recognition system. This paper introduces
with the Morphing Attack Potential (MAP) a consistent methodology, that can
quantify the risk, which a certain morphing attack creates.
