* Summary: The human footprint is having a unique set of ridges unmatched by any other
human being, and therefore it can be used in different identity documents for
example birth certificate, Indian biometric identification system AADHAR card,
driving license, PAN card, and passport. There are many instances of the crime
scene where an accused must walk around and left the footwear impressions as
well as barefoot prints and therefore, it is very crucial to recovering the
footprints from identifying the criminals. Footprint-based biometric is a
considerably newer technique for personal identification. Fingerprints, retina,
iris and face recognition are the methods most useful for attendance record of
the person. This time the world is facing the problem of global terrorism. It
is challenging to identify the terrorist because they are living as regular as
the citizens do. Their soft target includes the industries of special interests
such as defence, silicon and nanotechnology chip manufacturing units, pharmacy
sectors. They pretend themselves as religious persons, so temples and other
holy places, even in markets is in their targets. These are the places where
one can obtain their footprints quickly. The gait itself is sufficient to
predict the behaviour of the suspects. The present research is driven to
identify the usefulness of footprint and gait as an alternative to personal
identification.
