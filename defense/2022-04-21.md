* Summary: Due to the prosperity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, more and
more backdoors are designed by adversaries to attack Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs).Although the state-of-the-art method Neural Attention Distillation (NAD)
can effectively erase backdoor triggers from DNNs, it still suffers from
non-negligible Attack Success Rate (ASR) together with lowered classification
ACCuracy (ACC), since NAD focuses on backdoor defense using attention features
(i.e., attention maps) of the same order. In this paper, we introduce a novel
backdoor defense framework named Attention Relation Graph Distillation (ARGD),
which fully explores the correlation among attention features with different
orders using our proposed Attention Relation Graphs (ARGs). Based on the
alignment of ARGs between both teacher and student models during knowledge
distillation, ARGD can eradicate more backdoor triggers than NAD. Comprehensive
experimental results show that, against six latest backdoor attacks, ARGD
outperforms NAD by up to 94.85% reduction in ASR, while ACC can be improved by
up to 3.23%.

* Summary: Quantum key distribution (QKD) networks is expected to provide
information-theoretical secured (ITS) communication over long distances. QKD
networks based trusted relay architecture are now the most widely used scheme
in practice. However, it is an unrealistic assumption that all relays are fully
trustable in complex networks. In the past, only a few studies have
theoretically analyzed the case of passive eavesdropping attack by dishonest
relays and corresponding defense method. However, we have found that active
attacks by dishonest relays can be more threatening. With the consideration of
passive and active attacks, we treat dishonest relays as Byzantine nodes and
analyzes the upper limit of Byzantine nodes that the QKD network can
accommodate. In this paper, we propose an ITS Byzantine-fault tolerance (BFT)
QKD network scheme to achieve end-to-end key distribution based on
point-to-point QKD links. To ensure consistency and provide BFT ability in the
QKD network, we design an ITSBFT-consensus protocol for this network scheme. To
ensure the information-theoretic security of consensus, we design a temporary
signature scheme based on point-to-point QKD link keys. To prevent Byzantine
nodes from disrupting the execution process of key distribution, we design an
end-to-end key distribution scheme combined with consensus. We theoretically
analyze proposed ITSBFT-QKD network scheme from four aspects: QKD key
distribution security, temporary signature security, consensus security, and
leader election fairness. The simulation result proved the feasibility and
demonstrate the performance.
