* Summary: In cellular networks, resource allocation is performed in a centralized way,
which brings huge computation complexity to the base station (BS) and high
transmission overhead. This paper investigates the distributed resource
allocation scheme for cellular networks to maximize the energy efficiency of
the system in the uplink transmission, while guaranteeing the quality of
service (QoS) for cellular users. Particularly, to cope the fast varying
channels in wireless communication environment, we propose a robust federated
reinforcement learning (FRL_suc) framework to enable local users to perform
distributed resource allocation in items of transmit power and channel
assignment by the guidance of the local neural network trained at each user.
Analysis and numerical results show that the proposed FRL_suc framework can
lower the transmission overhead and offload the computation from the central
server to the local users, while outperforming the conventional multi-agent
reinforcement learning algorithm in terms of EE, and is more robust to channel
variations.

* Summary: Westerlund 1 (Wd 1) is one of the most massive young star clusters in the
Milky Way. Although relevant for star formation and evolution, its fundamental
parameters are not yet very well constrained. Our goal is to derive an accurate
distance and provide constraints on the cluster age. We used the photometric
and astrometric information available in the Gaia Early Data Release 3
(Gaia-EDR3) to infer its distance of 4.06$^{+0.36}_{-0.34}$ kpc. Modelling of
the eclipsing binary system W36 reported in Paper II led to the distance of
4.34$\pm$0.25 kpc, in agreement with the Gaia-EDR3 distance and, therefore,
validating the parallax zero-point correction approach appropriate for red
objects. By taking advantage of another two recent distance determinations
using the Gaia-EDR3, we obtained a weighted mean distance for the cluster as
d$_{\rm wd1}$=4.23$^{+0.15}_{-0.13}$ kpc ($m-M$=13.13$^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ mag),
which has an unprecedented accuracy of 4\%. We adopted recent Geneva
evolutionary tracks for supra-solar metallicity objects to infer the age of the
faintest RSG source from Wd 1, leading to a cluster age of 11.0$\pm$0.5 Myr, in
excellent agreement with recent work by Beasor \& Davies (10.4$^{+1.3}_{-1.2}$
Myr) based on MIST evolutionary models. The age of W36 was reported to be
3.5$\pm$0.5 Myr in Paper II, supporting recent claims of a temporal spread of
several Myr for the star-forming process within Wd 1 instead of a monolithic
starburst scenario.

* Summary: Federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a method to train a model on
different units without exchanging data. This offers great opportunities in the
healthcare sector, where large datasets are available but cannot be shared to
ensure patient privacy. We systematically investigate the effectiveness of FL
on the publicly available eICU dataset for predicting the survival of each ICU
stay. We employ Federated Averaging as the main practical algorithm for FL and
show how its performance changes by altering three key hyper-parameters, taking
into account that clients can significantly vary in size. We find that in many
settings, a large number of local training epochs improves the performance
while at the same time reducing communication costs. Furthermore, we outline in
which settings it is possible to have only a low number of hospitals
participating in each federated update round. When many hospitals with low
patient counts are involved, the effect of overfitting can be avoided by
decreasing the batchsize. This study thus contributes toward identifying
suitable settings for running distributed algorithms such as FL on clinical
datasets.

* Summary: The evolution of High-Performance Computing (HPC) platforms enables the
design and execution of progressively larger and more complex workflow
applications in these systems. The complexity comes not only from the number of
elements that compose the workflows but also from the type of computations they
perform. While traditional HPC workflows target simulations and modelling of
physical phenomena, current needs require in addition data analytics (DA) and
artificial intelligence (AI) tasks. However, the development of these workflows
is hampered by the lack of proper programming models and environments that
support the integration of HPC, DA, and AI, as well as the lack of tools to
easily deploy and execute the workflows in HPC systems. To progress in this
direction, this paper presents use cases where complex workflows are required
and investigates the main issues to be addressed for the HPC/DA/AI convergence.
Based on this study, the paper identifies the challenges of a new workflow
platform to manage complex workflows. Finally, it proposes a development
approach for such a workflow platform addressing these challenges in two
directions: first, by defining a software stack that provides the
functionalities to manage these complex workflows; and second, by proposing the
HPC Workflow as a Service (HPCWaaS) paradigm, which leverages the software
stack to facilitate the reusability of complex workflows in federated HPC
infrastructures. Proposals presented in this work are subject to study and
development as part of the EuroHPC eFlows4HPC project.

### Title: Is Non-IID Data a Threat in Federated Online Learning to Rank?

* Summary: In this perspective paper we study the effect of non independent and
identically distributed (non-IID) data on federated online learning to rank
(FOLTR) and chart directions for future work in this new and largely unexplored
research area of Information Retrieval. In the FOLTR process, clients join a
federation to jointly create an effective ranker from the implicit click signal
originating in each client, without the need to share data (documents, queries,
clicks). A well-known factor that affects the performance of federated learning
systems, and that poses serious challenges to these approaches, is the fact
that there may be some type of bias in the way the data is distributed across
clients. While FOLTR systems are on their own rights a type of federated
learning system, the presence and effect of non-IID data in FOLTR has not been
studied. To this aim, we first enumerate possible data distribution settings
that may showcase data bias across clients and thus give rise to the non-IID
problem. Then, we study the impact of each of these settings on the performance
of the current state-of-the-art FOLTR approach, the Federated Pairwise
Differentiable Gradient Descent (FPDGD), and we highlight which data
distributions may pose a problem for FOLTR methods. We also explore how common
approaches proposed in the federated learning literature address non-IID issues
in FOLTR. This allows us to unveil new research gaps that, we argue, future
research in FOLTR should consider. This is an important contribution to the
current state of the field of FOLTR because, for FOLTR systems to be deployed,
the factors affecting their performance, including the impact of non-IID data,
need to thoroughly be understood.

### Title: Federated Learning for Energy-limited Wireless Networks: A Partial Model Aggregation Approach

* Summary: The limited communication resources, e.g., bandwidth and energy, and data
heterogeneity across devices are two of the main bottlenecks for federated
learning (FL). To tackle these challenges, we first devise a novel FL framework
with partial model aggregation (PMA), which only aggregates the lower layers of
neural networks responsible for feature extraction while the upper layers
corresponding to complex pattern recognition remain at devices for
personalization. The proposed PMA-FL is able to address the data heterogeneity
and reduce the transmitted information in wireless channels. We then obtain a
convergence bound of the framework under a non-convex loss function setting.
With the aid of this bound, we define a new objective function, named the
scheduled data sample volume, to transfer the original inexplicit optimization
problem into a tractable one for device scheduling, bandwidth allocation,
computation and communication time division. Our analysis reveals that the
optimal time division is achieved when the communication and computation parts
of PMA-FL have the same power. We also develop a bisection method to solve the
optimal bandwidth allocation policy and use the set expansion algorithm to
address the optimal device scheduling. Compared with the state-of-the-art
benchmarks, the proposed PMA-FL improves 2.72% and 11.6% accuracy on two
typical heterogeneous datasets, i.e., MINIST and CIFAR-10, respectively. In
addition, the proposed joint dynamic device scheduling and resource
optimization approach achieve slightly higher accuracy than the considered
benchmarks, but they provide a satisfactory energy and time reduction: 29%
energy or 20% time reduction on the MNIST; and 25% energy or 12.5% time
reduction on the CIFAR-10.
