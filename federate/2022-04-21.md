* Summary: Contrastive learning is widely used for recommendation model learning, where
selecting representative and informative negative samples is critical. Existing
methods usually focus on centralized data, where abundant and high-quality
negative samples are easy to obtain. However, centralized user data storage and
exploitation may lead to privacy risks and concerns, while decentralized user
data on a single client can be too sparse and biased for accurate contrastive
learning. In this paper, we propose a federated contrastive learning method
named FedCL for privacy-preserving recommendation, which can exploit
high-quality negative samples for effective model training with privacy well
protected. We first infer user embeddings from local user data through the
local model on each client, and then perturb them with local differential
privacy (LDP) before sending them to a central server for hard negative
sampling. Since individual user embedding contains heavy noise due to LDP, we
propose to cluster user embeddings on the server to mitigate the influence of
noise, and the cluster centroids are used to retrieve hard negative samples
from the item pool. These hard negative samples are delivered to user clients
and mixed with the observed negative samples from local data as well as
in-batch negatives constructed from positive samples for federated model
training. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show FedCL can
empower various recommendation methods in a privacy-preserving way.

* Summary: Nowadays, blockchain-based technologies are being developed in various
industries to improve data security. In the context of the Industrial Internet
of Things (IIoT), a chain-based network is one of the most notable applications
of blockchain technology. IIoT devices have become increasingly prevalent in
our digital world, especially in support of developing smart factories.
Although blockchain is a powerful tool, it is vulnerable to cyber attacks.
Detecting anomalies in blockchain-based IIoT networks in smart factories is
crucial in protecting networks and systems from unexpected attacks. In this
paper, we use Federated Learning (FL) to build a threat hunting framework
called Block Hunter to automatically hunt for attacks in blockchain-based IIoT
networks. Block Hunter utilizes a cluster-based architecture for anomaly
detection combined with several machine learning models in a federated
environment. To the best of our knowledge, Block Hunter is the first federated
threat hunting model in IIoT networks that identifies anomalous behavior while
preserving privacy. Our results prove the efficiency of the Block Hunter in
detecting anomalous activities with high accuracy and minimum required
bandwidth.

### Title: German Parliamentary Corpus (GerParCor)

* Updated Date: 2022-04-21
* Code URL: [https://github.com/texttechnologylab/gerparcor](https://github.com/texttechnologylab/gerparcor)
* Summary: Parliamentary debates represent a large and partly unexploited treasure trove
of publicly accessible texts. In the German-speaking area, there is a certain
deficit of uniformly accessible and annotated corpora covering all
German-speaking parliaments at the national and federal level. To address this
gap, we introduce the German Parliament Corpus (GerParCor). GerParCor is a
genre-specific corpus of (predominantly historical) German-language
parliamentary protocols from three centuries and four countries, including
state and federal level data. In addition, GerParCor contains conversions of
scanned protocols and, in particular, of protocols in Fraktur converted via an
OCR process based on Tesseract. All protocols were preprocessed by means of the
NLP pipeline of spaCy3 and automatically annotated with metadata regarding
their session date. GerParCor is made available in the XMI format of the UIMA
project. In this way, GerParCor can be used as a large corpus of historical
texts in the field of political communication for various tasks in NLP.
