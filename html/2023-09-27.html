<li>Summary: <p>Counterfactual examples have proven to be valuable in the field of natural
language processing (NLP) for both evaluating and improving the robustness of
language models to spurious correlations in datasets. Despite their
demonstrated utility for NLP, multimodal counterfactual examples have been
relatively unexplored due to the difficulty of creating paired image-text data
with minimal counterfactual changes. To address this challenge, we introduce a
scalable framework for automatic generation of counterfactual examples using
text-to-image diffusion models. We use our framework to create
COCO-Counterfactuals, a multimodal counterfactual dataset of paired image and
text captions based on the MS-COCO dataset. We validate the quality of
COCO-Counterfactuals through human evaluations and show that existing
multimodal models are challenged by our counterfactual image-text pairs.
Additionally, we demonstrate the usefulness of COCO-Counterfactuals for
improving out-of-domain generalization of multimodal vision-language models via
training data augmentation.

<li>Summary: <p>Limited transferability hinders the performance of deep learning models when
applied to new application scenarios. Recently, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
(UDA) has achieved significant progress in addressing this issue via learning
domain-invariant features. However, the performance of existing UDA methods is
constrained by the large domain shift and limited target domain data. To
alleviate these issues, we propose DomAin-guided Conditional Diffusion Model
(DACDM) to generate high-fidelity and diversity samples for the target domain.
In the proposed DACDM, by introducing class information, the labels of
generated samples can be controlled, and a domain classifier is further
introduced in DACDM to guide the generated samples for the target domain. The
generated samples help existing UDA methods transfer from the source domain to
the target domain more easily, thus improving the transfer performance.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that DACDM brings a
large improvement to the performance of existing UDA methods.

<li>Summary: <p>Text-to-video is a rapidly growing research area that aims to generate a
semantic, identical, and temporal coherence sequence of frames that accurately
align with the input text prompt. This study focuses on zero-shot text-to-video
generation considering the data- and cost-efficient. To generate a
semantic-coherent video, exhibiting a rich portrayal of temporal semantics such
as the whole process of flower blooming rather than a set of "moving images",
we propose a novel Free-Bloom pipeline that harnesses large language models
(LLMs) as the director to generate a semantic-coherence prompt sequence, while
pre-trained latent diffusion models (LDMs) as the animator to generate the high
fidelity frames. Furthermore, to ensure temporal and identical coherence while
maintaining semantic coherence, we propose a series of annotative modifications
to adapting LDMs in the reverse process, including joint noise sampling,
step-aware attention shift, and dual-path interpolation. Without any video data
and training requirements, Free-Bloom generates vivid and high-quality videos,
awe-inspiring in generating complex scenes with semantic meaningful frame
sequences. In addition, Free-Bloom is naturally compatible with LDMs-based
extensions.

<li>Summary: <p>Learning-based methods have attracted a lot of research attention and led to
significant improvements in low-light image enhancement. However, most of them
still suffer from two main problems: expensive computational cost in high
resolution images and unsatisfactory performance in simultaneous enhancement
and denoising. To address these problems, we propose BDCE, a bootstrap
diffusion model that exploits the learning of the distribution of the curve
parameters instead of the normal-light image itself. Specifically, we adopt the
curve estimation method to handle the high-resolution images, where the curve
parameters are estimated by our bootstrap diffusion model. In addition, a
denoise module is applied in each iteration of curve adjustment to denoise the
intermediate enhanced result of each iteration. We evaluate BDCE on commonly
used benchmark datasets, and extensive experiments show that it achieves
state-of-the-art qualitative and quantitative performance.

<li>Summary: <p>Deepfake images are fast becoming a serious concern due to their realism.
Diffusion models have recently demonstrated highly realistic visual content
generation, which makes them an excellent potential tool for Deepfake
generation. To curb their exploitation for Deepfakes, it is imperative to first
explore the extent to which diffusion models can be used to generate realistic
content that is controllable with convenient prompts. This paper devises and
explores a novel method in that regard. Our technique alters the popular stable
diffusion model to generate a controllable high-quality Deepfake image with
text and image prompts. In addition, the original stable model lacks severely
in generating quality images that contain multiple persons. The modified
diffusion model is able to address this problem, it add input anchor image's
latent at the beginning of inferencing rather than Gaussian random latent as
input. Hence, we focus on generating forged content for celebrity interactions,
which may be used to spread rumors. We also apply Dreambooth to enhance the
realism of our fake images. Dreambooth trains the pairing of center words and
specific features to produce more refined and personalized output images. Our
results show that with the devised scheme, it is possible to create fake visual
content with alarming realism, such that the content can serve as believable
evidence of meetings between powerful political figures.

<li>Summary: <p>Recent advances in diffusion models have led to a quantum leap in the quality
of generative visual content. However, quantification of realism of the content
is still challenging. Existing evaluation metrics, such as Inception Score and
Fr\'echet inception distance, fall short on benchmarking diffusion models due
to the versatility of the generated images. Moreover, they are not designed to
quantify realism of an individual image. This restricts their application in
forensic image analysis, which is becoming increasingly important in the
emerging era of generative models. To address that, we first propose a metric,
called Image Realism Score (IRS), computed from five statistical measures of a
given image. This non-learning based metric not only efficiently quantifies
realism of the generated images, it is readily usable as a measure to classify
a given image as real or fake. We experimentally establish the model- and
data-agnostic nature of the proposed IRS by successfully detecting fake images
generated by Stable Diffusion Model (SDM), Dalle2, Midjourney and BigGAN.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We further leverage this attribute of our metric to minimize an IRS-augmented
generative loss of SDM, and demonstrate a convenient yet considerable quality
improvement of the SDM-generated content with our modification. Our efforts
have also led to Gen-100 dataset, which provides 1,000 samples for 100 classes
generated by four high-quality models. We will release the dataset and code.

<li>Summary: <p>Text-to-image generative models have garnered immense attention for their
ability to produce high-fidelity images from text prompts. Among these, Stable
Diffusion distinguishes itself as a leading open-source model in this
fast-growing field. However, the intricacies of fine-tuning these models pose
multiple challenges from new methodology integration to systematic evaluation.
Addressing these issues, this paper introduces LyCORIS (Lora beYond
Conventional methods, Other Rank adaptation Implementations for Stable

that offers a wide selection of fine-tuning methodologies for Stable Diffusion.
Furthermore, we present a thorough framework for the systematic assessment of
varied fine-tuning techniques. This framework employs a diverse suite of
metrics and delves into multiple facets of fine-tuning, including
hyperparameter adjustments and the evaluation with different prompt types
across various concept categories. Through this comprehensive approach, our

<li>Summary: <p>Texture editing is a crucial task in 3D modeling that allows users to
automatically manipulate the surface materials of 3D models. However, the
inherent complexity of 3D models and the ambiguous text description lead to the
challenge in this task. To address this challenge, we propose ITEM3D, an
illumination-aware model for automatic 3D object editing according to the text
prompts. Leveraging the diffusion models and the differentiable rendering,
ITEM3D takes the rendered images as the bridge of text and 3D representation,
and further optimizes the disentangled texture and environment map. Previous
methods adopt the absolute editing direction namely score distillation sampling
(SDS) as the optimization objective, which unfortunately results in the noisy
appearance and text inconsistency. To solve the problem caused by the ambiguous
text, we introduce a relative editing direction, an optimization objective
defined by the noise difference between the source and target texts, to release
the semantic ambiguity between the texts and images. Additionally, we gradually
adjust the direction during optimization to further address the unexpected
deviation in the texture domain. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show
that our ITEM3D outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various 3D objects.
We also perform text-guided relighting to show explicit control over lighting.

<li>Summary: <p>Text-conditional image editing is a very useful task that has recently
emerged with immeasurable potential. Most current real image editing methods
first need to complete the reconstruction of the image, and then editing is
carried out by various methods based on the reconstruction. Most methods use
DDIM Inversion for reconstruction, however, DDIM Inversion often fails to
guarantee reconstruction performance, i.e., it fails to produce results that
preserve the original image content. To address the problem of reconstruction
failure, we propose FEC, which consists of three sampling methods, each
designed for different editing types and settings. Our three methods of FEC
achieve two important goals in image editing task: 1) ensuring successful
reconstruction, i.e., sampling to get a generated result that preserves the
texture and features of the original real image. 2) these sampling methods can
be paired with many editing methods and greatly improve the performance of
these editing methods to accomplish various editing tasks. In addition, none of
our sampling methods require fine-tuning of the diffusion model or
time-consuming training on large-scale datasets. Hence the cost of time as well
as the use of computer memory and computation can be significantly reduced.

<li>Summary: <p>This work aims to learn a high-quality text-to-video (T2V) generative model
by leveraging a pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) model as a basis. It is a
highly desirable yet challenging task to simultaneously a) accomplish the
synthesis of visually realistic and temporally coherent videos while b)
preserving the strong creative generation nature of the pre-trained T2I model.
To this end, we propose LaVie, an integrated video generation framework that
operates on cascaded video latent diffusion models, comprising a base T2V
model, a temporal interpolation model, and a video super-resolution model. Our
key insights are two-fold: 1) We reveal that the incorporation of simple
temporal self-attentions, coupled with rotary positional encoding, adequately
captures the temporal correlations inherent in video data. 2) Additionally, we
validate that the process of joint image-video fine-tuning plays a pivotal role
in producing high-quality and creative outcomes. To enhance the performance of
LaVie, we contribute a comprehensive and diverse video dataset named Vimeo25M,
consisting of 25 million text-video pairs that prioritize quality, diversity,
and aesthetic appeal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaVie achieves
state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.
Furthermore, we showcase the versatility of pre-trained LaVie models in various

<li>Summary: <p>An emerging line of work has sought to generate plausible imagery from touch.
Existing approaches, however, tackle only narrow aspects of the visuo-tactile
synthesis problem, and lag significantly behind the quality of cross-modal
synthesis methods in other domains. We draw on recent advances in latent
diffusion to create a model for synthesizing images from tactile signals (and
vice versa) and apply it to a number of visuo-tactile synthesis tasks. Using
this model, we significantly outperform prior work on the tactile-driven
stylization problem, i.e., manipulating an image to match a touch signal, and
we are the first to successfully generate images from touch without additional
sources of information about the scene. We also successfully use our model to
address two novel synthesis problems: generating images that do not contain the
touch sensor or the hand holding it, and estimating an image's shading from its
reflectance and touch.

<li>Summary: <p>Domain-to-domain translation involves generating a target domain sample given
a condition in the source domain. Most existing methods focus on fixed input
and output domains, i.e. they only work for specific configurations (i.e. for
two domains, either $D_1\rightarrow{}D_2$ or $D_2\rightarrow{}D_1$). This paper
proposes Multi-Domain Diffusion (MDD), a conditional diffusion framework for
multi-domain translation in a semi-supervised context. Unlike previous methods,
MDD does not require defining input and output domains, allowing translation
between any partition of domains within a set (such as $(D_1,
D_2)\rightarrow{}D_3$, $D_2\rightarrow{}(D_1, D_3)$, $D_3\rightarrow{}D_1$,
etc. for 3 domains), without the need to train separate models for each domain
configuration. The key idea behind MDD is to leverage the noise formulation of
diffusion models by incorporating one noise level per domain, which allows
missing domains to be modeled with noise in a natural way. This transforms the
training task from a simple reconstruction task to a domain translation task,
where the model relies on less noisy domains to reconstruct more noisy domains.
We present results on a multi-domain (with more than two domains) synthetic
image translation dataset with challenging semantic domain inversion.

have created a need for improved quantization methods that can meet the
computational demands of these modern architectures while maintaining accuracy.
Towards this goal, we study the advantages of FP8 data formats for
post-training quantization across 75 unique network architectures covering a
wide range of tasks, including machine translation, language modeling, text
generation, image classification, generation, and segmentation. We examine
three different FP8 representations (E5M2, E4M3, and E3M4) to study the effects
of varying degrees of trade-off between dynamic range and precision on model
accuracy. Based on our extensive study, we developed a quantization workflow
that generalizes across different network architectures. Our empirical results
show that FP8 formats outperform INT8 in multiple aspects, including workload
coverage (92.64% vs. 65.87%), model accuracy and suitability for a broader
range of operations. Furthermore, our findings suggest that E4M3 is better
suited for NLP models, whereas E3M4 performs marginally better than E4M3 on
computer vision tasks. The code is publicly available on Intel Neural

<li>Summary: <p>Deep Image Manipulation Localization (IML) models suffer from training data
insufficiency and thus heavily rely on pre-training. We argue that contrastive
learning is more suitable to tackle the data insufficiency problem for IML.
Crafting mutually exclusive positives and negatives is the prerequisite for
contrastive learning. However, when adopting contrastive learning in IML, we
encounter three categories of image patches: tampered, authentic, and contour
patches. Tampered and authentic patches are naturally mutually exclusive, but
contour patches containing both tampered and authentic pixels are non-mutually
exclusive to them. Simply abnegating these contour patches results in a drastic
performance loss since contour patches are decisive to the learning outcomes.
Hence, we propose the Non-mutually exclusive Contrastive Learning (NCL)
framework to rescue conventional contrastive learning from the above dilemma.
In NCL, to cope with the non-mutually exclusivity, we first establish a pivot
structure with dual branches to constantly switch the role of contour patches
between positives and negatives while training. Then, we devise a
pivot-consistent loss to avoid spatial corruption caused by the role-switching
process. In this manner, NCL both inherits the self-supervised merits to
address the data insufficiency and retains a high manipulation localization
accuracy. Extensive experiments verify that our NCL achieves state-of-the-art
performance on all five benchmarks without any pre-training and is more robust
on unseen real-life samples. The code is available at:

work focuses on establishing the dense correspondence between a pair of images
that captures dynamic scenes undergoing substantial transformations. We
introduce Doduo to learn general dense visual correspondence from in-the-wild
images and videos without ground truth supervision. Given a pair of images, it
estimates the dense flow field encoding the displacement of each pixel in one
image to its corresponding pixel in the other image. Doduo uses flow-based
warping to acquire supervisory signals for the training. Incorporating semantic
priors with self-supervised flow training, Doduo produces accurate dense
correspondence robust to the dynamic changes of the scenes. Trained on an
in-the-wild video dataset, Doduo illustrates superior performance on
point-level correspondence estimation over existing self-supervised
correspondence learning baselines. We also apply Doduo to articulation
estimation and zero-shot goal-conditioned manipulation, underlining its
practical applications in robotics. Code and additional visualizations are

<li>Summary: <p>Vision foundation models are a new frontier in GeoAI research because of
their potential to enable powerful image analysis by learning and extracting
important image features from vast amounts of geospatial data. This paper
evaluates the performance of the first-of-its-kind geospatial foundation model,
IBM-NASA's Prithvi, to support a crucial geospatial analysis task: flood
inundation mapping. This model is compared with popular convolutional neural
network and vision transformer-based architectures in terms of mapping accuracy
for flooded areas. A benchmark dataset, Sen1Floods11, is used in the
experiments, and the models' predictability, generalizability, and
transferability are evaluated based on both a test dataset and a dataset that
is completely unseen by the model. Results show the impressive transferability
of the Prithvi model, highlighting its performance advantages in segmenting
flooded areas in previously unseen regions. The findings also suggest areas for
improvement for the Prithvi model in terms of adopting multi-scale

<li>Summary: <p>This paper proposes a fully-automatic, text-guided generative method for
producing periodic, repeating, tile-able 2D art, such as the one seen on
floors, mosaics, ceramics, and the work of M.C. Escher. In contrast to the
standard concept of a seamless texture, i.e., square images that are seamless
when tiled, our method generates non-square tilings which comprise solely of
repeating copies of the same object. It achieves this by optimizing both
geometry and color of a 2D mesh, in order to generate a non-square tile in the
shape and appearance of the desired object, with close to no additional
background details. We enable geometric optimization of tilings by our key
technical contribution: an unconstrained, differentiable parameterization of
the space of all possible tileable shapes for a given symmetry group. Namely,
we prove that modifying the laplacian used in a 2D mesh-mapping technique -
Orbifold Tutte Embedding - can achieve all possible tiling configurations for a
chosen planar symmetry group. We thus consider both the mesh's tile-shape and
its texture as optimizable parameters, rendering the textured mesh via a
differentiable renderer. We leverage a trained image diffusion model to define
a loss on the resulting image, thereby updating the mesh's parameters based on

<li>Summary: <p>The difference between the chronological and biological brain age of a
subject can be an important biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases, thus
brain age estimation can be crucial in clinical settings. One way to
incorporate multimodal information into this estimation is through population
graphs, which combine various types of imaging data and capture the
associations among individuals within a population. In medical imaging,
population graphs have demonstrated promising results, mostly for
classification tasks. In most cases, the graph structure is pre-defined and
remains static during training. However, extracting population graphs is a
non-trivial task and can significantly impact the performance of Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), which are sensitive to the graph structure. In this work, we
highlight the importance of a meaningful graph construction and experiment with
different population-graph construction methods and their effect on GNN
performance on brain age estimation. We use the homophily metric and graph
visualizations to gain valuable quantitative and qualitative insights on the
extracted graph structures. For the experimental evaluation, we leverage the UK
Biobank dataset, which offers many imaging and non-imaging phenotypes. Our
results indicate that architectures highly sensitive to the graph structure,
such as Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Graph Attention Network (GAT),
struggle with low homophily graphs, while other architectures, such as
GraphSage and Chebyshev, are more robust across different homophily ratios. We
conclude that static graph construction approaches are potentially insufficient
for the task of brain age estimation and make recommendations for alternative
research directions.

<li>Summary: <p>We present a locality-aware method for interpreting the latent space of
wavelet-based Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), that can well capture the
large spatial and spectral variability that is characteristic to satellite
imagery. By focusing on preserving locality, the proposed method is able to
decompose the weight-space of pre-trained GANs and recover interpretable
directions that correspond to high-level semantic concepts (such as
urbanization, structure density, flora presence) - that can subsequently be
used for guided synthesis of satellite imagery. In contrast to typically used
approaches that focus on capturing the variability of the weight-space in a
reduced dimensionality space (i.e., based on Principal Component Analysis,
PCA), we show that preserving locality leads to vectors with different angles,
that are more robust to artifacts and can better preserve class information.
Via a set of quantitative and qualitative examples, we further show that the
proposed approach can outperform both baseline geometric augmentations, as well
as global, PCA-based approaches for data synthesis in the context of data
augmentation for satellite scene classification.

<li>Summary: <p>The increasing capacities of large language models (LLMs) present an
unprecedented opportunity to scale up data analytics in the humanities and
social sciences, augmenting and automating qualitative analytic tasks
previously typically allocated to human labor. This contribution proposes a
systematic mixed methods framework to harness qualitative analytic expertise,
machine scalability, and rigorous quantification, with attention to
transparency and replicability. 16 machine-assisted case studies are showcased
as proof of concept. Tasks include linguistic and discourse analysis, lexical
semantic change detection, interview analysis, historical event cause inference
and text mining, detection of political stance, text and idea reuse, genre
composition in literature and film; social network inference, automated
lexicography, missing metadata augmentation, and multimodal visual cultural
analytics. In contrast to the focus on English in the emerging LLM
applicability literature, many examples here deal with scenarios involving
smaller languages and historical texts prone to digitization distortions. In
all but the most difficult tasks requiring expert knowledge, generative LLMs
can demonstrably serve as viable research instruments. LLM (and human)
annotations may contain errors and variation, but the agreement rate can and
should be accounted for in subsequent statistical modeling; a bootstrapping
approach is discussed. The replications among the case studies illustrate how
tasks previously requiring potentially months of team effort and complex
computational pipelines, can now be accomplished by an LLM-assisted scholar in
a fraction of the time. Importantly, this approach is not intended to replace,
but to augment researcher knowledge and skills. With these opportunities in
sight, qualitative expertise and the ability to pose insightful questions have
arguably never been more critical.

<li>Summary: <p>The use of machine learning (ML) models to assess and score textual data has
become increasingly pervasive in an array of contexts including natural
language processing, information retrieval, search and recommendation, and
credibility assessment of online content. A significant disruption at the
intersection of ML and text are text-generating large-language models such as
generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs). We empirically assess the
differences in how ML-based scoring models trained on human content assess the
quality of content generated by humans versus GPTs. To do so, we propose an
analysis framework that encompasses essay scoring ML-models, human and
ML-generated essays, and a statistical model that parsimoniously considers the
impact of type of respondent, prompt genre, and the ML model used for
assessment model. A rich testbed is utilized that encompasses 18,460
human-generated and GPT-based essays. Results of our benchmark analysis reveal
that transformer pretrained language models (PLMs) more accurately score human
essay quality as compared to CNN/RNN and feature-based ML methods.
Interestingly, we find that the transformer PLMs tend to score GPT-generated
text 10-15\% higher on average, relative to human-authored documents.
Conversely, traditional deep learning and feature-based ML models score human
text considerably higher. Further analysis reveals that although the
transformer PLMs are exclusively fine-tuned on human text, they more
prominently attend to certain tokens appearing only in GPT-generated text,
possibly due to familiarity/overlap in pre-training. Our framework and results
have implications for text classification settings where automated scoring of
text is likely to be disrupted by generative AI.

<li>Summary: <p>The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has boosted performance and
possibilities in various NLP tasks. While the usage of generative AI models
like ChatGPT opens up new opportunities for several business use cases, their
current tendency to hallucinate fake content strongly limits their
applicability to document analysis, such as information retrieval from
documents. In contrast, extractive language models like question answering (QA)
or passage retrieval models guarantee query results to be found within the
boundaries of an according context document, which makes them candidates for
more reliable information extraction in productive environments of companies.
In this work we propose an approach that uses and integrates extractive QA
models for improved feature extraction of German business documents such as
insurance reports or medical leaflets into a document analysis solution. We
further show that fine-tuning existing German QA models boosts performance for
tailored extraction tasks of complex linguistic features like damage cause
explanations or descriptions of medication appearance, even with using only a
small set of annotated data. Finally, we discuss the relevance of scoring
metrics for evaluating information extraction tasks and deduce a combined
metric from Levenshtein distance, F1-Score, Exact Match and ROUGE-L to mimic
the assessment criteria from human experts.

In this paper, we design and evaluate an automated question generation tool for

one hundred and four teachers, demonstrating the need for automated generation

facilitate personalized learning experiences. Leveraging the recent
advancements in generative AI, we then present a modular framework employing
transformer based language models for automatic generation of multiple-choice
questions (MCQs) from textual content. The presented solution, with distinct
modules for question generation, correct answer prediction, and distractor
formulation, enables us to evaluate different language models and generation

may assert their right to opt in or out of AI training as well as receive
reward for their contributions. Generative AI (GenAI) enables images to be
synthesized using AI models trained on vast amounts of data scraped from public
sources. Model and content creators who may wish to share their work openly
without sanctioning its use for training are thus presented with a data
governance challenge. Further, establishing the provenance of GenAI training
data is important to creatives to ensure fair recognition and reward for their
such use. We report a prototype of DECORAIT, which explores hierarchical
clustering and a combination of on/off-chain storage to create a scalable
decentralized registry to trace the provenance of GenAI training data in order
to determine training consent and reward creatives who contribute that data.
DECORAIT combines distributed ledger technology (DLT) with visual
fingerprinting, leveraging the emerging C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance

<li>Summary: <p>Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) models have recently attracted a
great deal of interest from a variety of application sectors. Despite
significant developments in this area, there are still no standardized methods
or approaches for understanding AI model outputs. A systematic and cohesive
framework is also increasingly necessary to incorporate new techniques like
discriminative and generative models to close the gap. This paper contributes
to the discourse on XAI by presenting an empirical evaluation based on a novel
framework: Sampling - Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) - Ensemble Anomaly
Detection (SVEAD). It is a hybrid architecture where VAE combined with ensemble
stacking and SHapley Additive exPlanations are used for imbalanced
classification. The finding reveals that combining ensemble stacking, VAE, and
SHAP can. not only lead to better model performance but also provide an easily
explainable framework. This work has used SHAP combined with Permutation
Importance and Individual Conditional Expectations to create a powerful
interpretability of the model. The finding has an important implication in the
real world, where the need for XAI is paramount to boost confidence in AI
applications.

to enhance the use of the divide and conquer strategy in video anomaly

<li>Summary: <p>Detecting system anomalies based on log data is important for ensuring the
security and reliability of computer systems. Recently, deep learning models
have been widely used for log anomaly detection. The core idea is to model the
log sequences as natural language and adopt deep sequential models, such as
LSTM or Transformer, to encode the normal patterns in log sequences via
language modeling. However, there is a gap between language modeling and
anomaly detection as the objective of training a sequential model via a
language modeling loss is not directly related to anomaly detection. To fill up
the gap, we propose LogGPT, a novel framework that employs GPT for log anomaly
detection. LogGPT is first trained to predict the next log entry based on the
preceding sequence. To further enhance the performance of LogGPT, we propose a
novel reinforcement learning strategy to finetune the model specifically for
the log anomaly detection task. The experimental results on three datasets show
that LogGPT significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

<li>Summary: <p>Time series classification is essential in many fields, such as medicine,
finance, environmental science, and manufacturing, enabling tasks like disease
diagnosis, anomaly detection, and stock price prediction. Machine learning
models like Recurrent Neural Networks and InceptionTime, while successful in
numerous applications, can face scalability limitations due to intensive
training requirements. To address this, random convolutional kernel models such
as Rocket and its derivatives have emerged, simplifying training and achieving
state-of-the-art performance by utilizing a large number of randomly generated
features from time series data. However, due to their random nature, most of
the generated features are redundant or non-informative, adding unnecessary
computational load and compromising generalization. Here, we introduce
Sequential Feature Detachment (SFD) as a method to identify and prune these
non-essential features. SFD uses model coefficients to estimate feature
importance and, unlike previous algorithms, can handle large feature sets
without the need for complex hyperparameter tuning. Testing on the UCR archive
demonstrates that SFD can produce models with $10\%$ of the original features
while improving $0.2\%$ the accuracy on the test set. We also present an
end-to-end procedure for determining an optimal balance between the number of
features and model accuracy, called Detach-ROCKET. When applied to the largest
binary UCR dataset, Detach-ROCKET is capable of reduce model size by $98.9\%$
and increases test accuracy by $0.6\%$.

<li>Summary: <p>In-Context Learning (ICL) over Large language models (LLMs) aims at solving
previously unseen tasks by conditioning on a few training examples, eliminating
the need for parameter updates and achieving competitive performance. In this
paper, we demonstrate that factual knowledge is imperative for the performance
of ICL in three core facets, i.e., the inherent knowledge learned in LLMs, the
factual knowledge derived from the selected in-context examples, and the
knowledge biases in LLMs for output generation. To unleash the power of LLMs in
few-shot learning scenarios, we introduce a novel Knowledgeable In-Context
Tuning (KICT) framework to further improve the performance of ICL: 1) injecting
factual knowledge to LLMs during continual self-supervised pre-training, 2)
judiciously selecting the examples with high knowledge relevance, and 3)
calibrating the prediction results based on prior knowledge. We evaluate the
proposed approaches on auto-regressive LLMs (e.g., GPT-style models) over
multiple text classification and question answering tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that KICT substantially outperforms strong baselines, and improves
by more than 13% and 7% of accuracy on text classification and question

<li>Summary: <p>Despite the promising few-shot ability of large language models (LLMs), the
standard paradigm of In-context Learning (ICL) suffers the disadvantages of
susceptibility to selected demonstrations and the intricacy to generate these
demonstrations. In this paper, we raise the fundamental question that whether
human-generated demonstrations are necessary for ICL. To answer this question,
we propose self-contemplation prompting strategy (SEC), a paradigm free from
human-crafted demonstrations. The key point of SEC is that, instead of using
hand-crafted examples as demonstrations in ICL, SEC asks LLMs to first create
demonstrations on their own, based on which the final output is generated. SEC
is a flexible framework and can be adapted to both the vanilla ICL and the
chain-of-thought (CoT), but with greater ease: as the manual-generation process
of both examples and rationale can be saved. Extensive experiments in
arithmetic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, multi-task language understanding,
and code generation benchmarks, show that SEC, which does not require
hand-crafted demonstrations, significantly outperforms the zero-shot learning
strategy, and achieves comparable results to ICL with hand-crafted
demonstrations. This demonstrates that, for many tasks, contemporary LLMs
possess a sufficient level of competence to exclusively depend on their own
capacity for decision making, removing the need for external training data.

<li>Summary: <p>Adapting visual object detectors to operational target domains is a
challenging task, commonly achieved using unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)
methods. When the labeled dataset is coming from multiple source domains,
treating them as separate domains and performing a multi-source domain
adaptation (MSDA) improves the accuracy and robustness over mixing these source
domains and performing a UDA, as observed by recent studies in MSDA. Existing
MSDA methods learn domain invariant and domain-specific parameters (for each
source domain) for the adaptation. However, unlike single-source UDA methods,
learning domain-specific parameters makes them grow significantly proportional
to the number of source domains used. This paper proposes a novel MSDA method
called Prototype-based Mean-Teacher (PMT), which uses class prototypes instead
of domain-specific subnets to preserve domain-specific information. These
prototypes are learned using a contrastive loss, aligning the same categories
across domains and separating different categories far apart. Because of the
use of prototypes, the parameter size of our method does not increase
significantly with the number of source domains, thus reducing memory issues
and possible overfitting. Empirical studies show PMT outperforms
state-of-the-art MSDA methods on several challenging object detection datasets.

there has been a recent surge in efforts to integrate them with AI agents to
enhance their performance. In this paper, we have explored the core differences
and characteristics between LLM-based AI agents and traditional AI agents.
Specifically, we first compare the fundamental characteristics of these two

handling natural language, knowledge storage, and reasoning capabilities.
Subsequently, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the key components of AI
agents, including planning, memory, and tool use. Particularly, for the crucial
component of memory, this paper introduced an innovative classification scheme,
not only departing from traditional classification methods but also providing a
fresh perspective on the design of an AI agent's memory system. We firmly

<li>Summary: <p>Computation in a typical Transformer-based large language model (LLM) can be
characterized by batch size, hidden dimension, number of layers, and sequence
length. Until now, system works for accelerating LLM training have focused on
the first three dimensions: data parallelism for batch size, tensor parallelism
for hidden size and pipeline parallelism for model depth or layers. These
widely studied forms of parallelism are not targeted or optimized for long
sequence Transformer models. Given practical application needs for long
sequence LLM, renewed attentions are being drawn to sequence parallelism.
However, existing works in sequence parallelism are constrained by
memory-communication inefficiency, limiting their scalability to long sequence
large models. In this work, we introduce DeepSpeed-Ulysses, a novel, portable
and effective methodology for enabling highly efficient and scalable LLM
training with extremely long sequence length. DeepSpeed-Ulysses at its core
partitions input data along the sequence dimension and employs an efficient
all-to-all collective communication for attention computation. Theoretical
communication analysis shows that whereas other methods incur communication
overhead as sequence length increases, DeepSpeed-Ulysses maintains constant
communication volume when sequence length and compute devices are increased
proportionally. Furthermore, experimental evaluations show that
DeepSpeed-Ulysses trains 2.5X faster with 4X longer sequence length than the
existing method SOTA baseline.

<li>Summary: <p>Continual learning necessitates the continual adaptation of models to newly
emerging tasks while minimizing the catastrophic forgetting of old ones. This
is extremely challenging for large language models (LLMs) with vanilla
full-parameter tuning due to high computation costs, memory consumption, and
forgetting issue. Inspired by the success of parameter-efficient tuning (PET),
we propose Continual Parameter-Efficient Tuning (ConPET), a generalizable
paradigm for continual task adaptation of LLMs with task-number-independent
training complexity. ConPET includes two versions with different application
scenarios. First, Static ConPET can adapt former continual learning methods
originally designed for relatively smaller models to LLMs through PET and a
dynamic replay strategy, which largely reduces the tuning costs and alleviates
the over-fitting and forgetting issue. Furthermore, to maintain scalability,
Dynamic ConPET adopts separate PET modules for different tasks and a PET module
selector for dynamic optimal selection. In our extensive experiments, the
adaptation of Static ConPET helps multiple former methods reduce the scale of
tunable parameters by over 3,000 times and surpass the PET-only baseline by at
least 5 points on five smaller benchmarks, while Dynamic ConPET gains its
advantage on the largest dataset. The codes and datasets are available at
https://github.com/Raincleared-Song/ConPET.

<li>Summary: <p>Purpose: Recent disruptive events, such as COVID-19 and Russia-Ukraine
conflict, had a significant impact of global supply chains. Digital supply
chain twins have been proposed in order to provide decision makers with an
effective and efficient tool to mitigate disruption impact. Methods: This paper
introduces a hybrid deep learning approach for disruption detection within a
cognitive digital supply chain twin framework to enhance supply chain
resilience. The proposed disruption detection module utilises a deep
autoencoder neural network combined with a one-class support vector machine
algorithm. In addition, long-short term memory neural network models are
developed to identify the disrupted echelon and predict time-to-recovery from
the disruption effect. Results: The obtained information from the proposed
approach will help decision-makers and supply chain practitioners make
appropriate decisions aiming at minimizing negative impact of disruptive events
based on real-time disruption detection data. The results demonstrate the
trade-off between disruption detection model sensitivity, encountered delay in
disruption detection, and false alarms. This approach has seldom been used in
recent literature addressing this issue.

<li>Summary: <p>Artificial neural networks (ANNs) with recurrence and self-attention have
been shown to be Turing-complete (TC). However, existing work has shown that
these ANNs require multiple turns or unbounded computation time, even with
unbounded precision in weights, in order to recognize TC grammars. However,
under constraints such as fixed or bounded precision neurons and time, ANNs
without memory are shown to struggle to recognize even context-free languages.
In this work, we extend the theoretical foundation for the $2^{nd}$-order
recurrent network ($2^{nd}$ RNN) and prove there exists a class of a $2^{nd}$
RNN that is Turing-complete with bounded time. This model is capable of
directly encoding a transition table into its recurrent weights, enabling
bounded time computation and is interpretable by design. We also demonstrate
that $2$nd order RNNs, without memory, under bounded weights and time
constraints, outperform modern-day models such as vanilla RNNs and gated
recurrent units in recognizing regular grammars. We provide an upper bound and
a stability analysis on the maximum number of neurons required by $2$nd order
RNNs to recognize any class of regular grammar. Extensive experiments on the
Tomita grammars support our findings, demonstrating the importance of tensor
connections in crafting computationally efficient RNNs. Finally, we show
$2^{nd}$ order RNNs are also interpretable by extraction and can extract state
machines with higher success rates as compared to first-order RNNs. Our results
extend the theoretical foundations of RNNs and offer promising avenues for
future explainable AI research.

<li>Summary: <p>Recently years have witnessed a rapid development of large language models
(LLMs). Despite the strong ability in many language-understanding tasks, the
heavy computational burden largely restricts the application of LLMs especially
when one needs to deploy them onto edge devices. In this paper, we propose a
quantization-aware low-rank adaptation (QA-LoRA) algorithm. The motivation lies
in the imbalanced degrees of freedom of quantization and adaptation, and the
solution is to use group-wise operators which increase the degree of freedom of
quantization meanwhile decreasing that of adaptation. QA-LoRA is easily
implemented with a few lines of code, and it equips the original LoRA with
two-fold abilities: (i) during fine-tuning, the LLM's weights are quantized
(e.g., into INT4) to reduce time and memory usage; (ii) after fine-tuning, the
LLM and auxiliary weights are naturally integrated into a quantized model
without loss of accuracy. We apply QA-LoRA to the LLaMA and LLaMA2 model
families and validate its effectiveness in different fine-tuning datasets and
downstream scenarios. Code will be made available at

<li>Summary: <p>In continual learning, many classifiers use softmax function to learn
confidence. However, numerous studies have pointed out its inability to
accurately determine confidence distributions for outliers, often referred to
as epistemic uncertainty. This inherent limitation also curtails the accurate
decisions for selecting what to forget and keep in previously trained
confidence distributions over continual learning process. To address the issue,
we revisit the effects of masking softmax function. While this method is both
simple and prevalent in literature, its implication for retaining confidence
distribution during continual learning, also known as stability, has been
under-investigated. In this paper, we revisit the impact of softmax masking,
and introduce a methodology to utilize its confidence preservation effects. In
class- and task-incremental learning benchmarks with and without memory replay,
our approach significantly increases stability while maintaining sufficiently
large plasticity. In the end, our methodology shows better overall performance
than state-of-the-art methods, particularly in the use with zero or small
memory. This lays a simple and effective foundation of strongly stable
replay-based continual learning.

<li>Summary: <p>Machine learning (ML) methods offer a wide range of configurable
hyperparameters that have a significant influence on their performance. While
accuracy is a commonly used performance objective, in many settings, it is not
sufficient. Optimizing the ML models with respect to multiple objectives such
as accuracy, confidence, fairness, calibration, privacy, latency, and memory
consumption is becoming crucial. To that end, hyperparameter optimization, the
approach to systematically optimize the hyperparameters, which is already
challenging for a single objective, is even more challenging for multiple
objectives. In addition, the differences in objective scales, the failures, and
the presence of outlier values in objectives make the problem even harder. We
propose a multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MoBO) algorithm that addresses
these problems through uniform objective normalization and randomized weights
in scalarization. We increase the efficiency of our approach by imposing
constraints on the objective to avoid exploring unnecessary configurations
(e.g., insufficient accuracy). Finally, we leverage an approach to parallelize
the MoBO which results in a 5x speed-up when using 16x more workers.

<li>Summary: <p>Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models have achieved very
impressive performance in various zero-shot image classification tasks. While
prior studies have demonstrated significant improvements by introducing
few-shot labelled target samples, they still require labelling of target
samples, which greatly degrades their scalability while handling various visual
recognition tasks. We design NtUA, a Noise-tolerant Unsupervised Adapter that
allows learning superior target models with few-shot unlabelled target samples.
NtUA works as a key-value cache that formulates visual features and predicted
pseudo-labels of the few-shot unlabelled target samples as key-value pairs. It
consists of two complementary designs. The first is adaptive cache formation
that combats pseudo-label noises by weighting the key-value pairs according to
their prediction confidence. The second is pseudo-label rectification, which
corrects both pair values (i.e., pseudo-labels) and cache weights by leveraging
knowledge distillation from large-scale vision language models. Extensive
experiments show that NtUA achieves superior performance consistently across
multiple widely adopted benchmarks.

<li>Summary: <p>Domain-specific text classification faces the challenge of scarce labeled
data due to the high cost of manual labeling. Prompt-learning, known for its
efficiency in few-shot scenarios, is proposed as an alternative to traditional
fine-tuning methods. And besides, although large language models (LLMs) have
gained prominence, small language models (SLMs, with under 1B parameters) offer
significant customizability, adaptability, and cost-effectiveness for
domain-specific tasks, given industry constraints. In this study, we
investigate the potential of SLMs combined with prompt-learning paradigm for
domain-specific text classification, specifically within customer-agent
interactions in retail. Our evaluations show that, in few-shot settings when
prompt-based model fine-tuning is possible, T5-base, a typical SLM with 220M
parameters, achieve approximately 75% accuracy with limited labeled data (up to
15% of full data), which shows great potentials of SLMs with prompt-learning.
Based on this, We further validate the effectiveness of active few-shot
sampling and the ensemble strategy in the prompt-learning pipeline that
contribute to a remarkable performance gain. Besides, in zero-shot settings
with a fixed model, we underscore a pivotal observation that, although the
GPT-3.5-turbo equipped with around 154B parameters garners an accuracy of
55.16%, the power of well designed prompts becomes evident when the
FLAN-T5-large, a model with a mere 0.5% of GPT-3.5-turbo's parameters, achieves
an accuracy exceeding 31% with the optimized prompt, a leap from its sub-18%
performance with an unoptimized one. Our findings underscore the promise of
prompt-learning in classification tasks with SLMs, emphasizing the benefits of
active few-shot sampling, and ensemble strategies in few-shot settings, and the
importance of prompt engineering in zero-shot settings.

<li>Summary: <p>Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is notoriously impractical to deploy due to
sample inefficiency. Meta-RL directly addresses this sample inefficiency by
learning to perform few-shot learning when a distribution of related tasks is
available for meta-training. While many specialized meta-RL methods have been
proposed, recent work suggests that end-to-end learning in conjunction with an
off-the-shelf sequential model, such as a recurrent network, is a surprisingly
strong baseline. However, such claims have been controversial due to limited
supporting evidence, particularly in the face of prior work establishing
precisely the opposite. In this paper, we conduct an empirical investigation.
While we likewise find that a recurrent network can achieve strong performance,
we demonstrate that the use of hypernetworks is crucial to maximizing their
potential. Surprisingly, when combined with hypernetworks, the recurrent
baselines that are far simpler than existing specialized methods actually
achieve the strongest performance of all methods evaluated.
