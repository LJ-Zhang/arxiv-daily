<li>Summary: <p>Enhancing a still image with motion offers more engaged visual experience.
Traditional image animation techniques mainly focus on animating natural scenes
with random dynamics, such as clouds and fluid, and thus limits their
applicability to generic visual contents. To overcome this limitation, we
explore the synthesis of dynamic content for open-domain images, converting
them into animated videos. The key idea is to utilize the motion prior of
text-to-video diffusion models by incorporating the image into the generative
process as guidance. Given an image, we first project it into a text-aligned
rich image embedding space using a learnable image encoding network, which
facilitates the video model to digest the image content compatibly. However,
some visual details still struggle to be preserved in the resulting videos. To
supplement more precise image information, we further feed the full image to
the diffusion model by concatenating it with the initial noises. Experimental
results reveal that our proposed method produces visually convincing animated
videos, exhibiting both natural motions and high fidelity to the input image.
Comparative evaluation demonstrates the notable superiority of our approach
over existing competitors. The source code will be released upon publication.

<li>Summary: <p>High-resolution 3D object generation remains a challenging task primarily due
to the limited availability of comprehensive annotated training data. Recent
advancements have aimed to overcome this constraint by harnessing image
generative models, pretrained on extensive curated web datasets, using
knowledge transfer techniques like Score Distillation Sampling (SDS).
Efficiently addressing the requirements of high-resolution rendering often
necessitates the adoption of latent representation-based models, such as the
Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). In this framework, a significant challenge
arises: To compute gradients for individual image pixels, it is necessary to
backpropagate gradients from the designated latent space through the frozen
components of the image model, such as the VAE encoder used within LDM.
However, this gradient propagation pathway has never been optimized, remaining
uncontrolled during training. We find that the unregulated gradients adversely
affect the 3D model's capacity in acquiring texture-related information from
the image generative model, leading to poor quality appearance synthesis. To
address this overarching challenge, we propose an innovative operation termed
Pixel-wise Gradient Clipping (PGC) designed for seamless integration into
existing 3D generative models, thereby enhancing their synthesis quality.
Specifically, we control the magnitude of stochastic gradients by clipping the
pixel-wise gradients efficiently, while preserving crucial texture-related
gradient directions. Despite this simplicity and minimal extra cost, extensive
experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our PGC in enhancing the performance of
existing 3D generative models for high-resolution object rendering.

<li>Summary: <p>Latent diffusion models excel at producing high-quality images from text.
Yet, concerns appear about the lack of diversity in the generated imagery. To
tackle this, we introduce Diverse Diffusion, a method for boosting image
diversity beyond gender and ethnicity, spanning into richer realms, including
color diversity.Diverse Diffusion is a general unsupervised technique that can
be applied to existing text-to-image models. Our approach focuses on finding
vectors in the Stable Diffusion latent space that are distant from each other.
We generate multiple vectors in the latent space until we find a set of vectors
that meets the desired distance requirements and the required batch size.To
evaluate the effectiveness of our diversity methods, we conduct experiments
examining various characteristics, including color diversity, LPIPS metric, and
ethnicity/gender representation in images featuring humans.The results of our
experiments emphasize the significance of diversity in generating realistic and
varied images, offering valuable insights for improving text-to-image models.
Through the enhancement of image diversity, our approach contributes to the
creation of more inclusive and representative AI-generated art.

<li>Summary: <p>Large-scale, big-variant, and high-quality data are crucial for developing
robust and successful deep-learning models for medical applications since they
potentially enable better generalization performance and avoid overfitting.
However, the scarcity of high-quality labeled data always presents significant
challenges. This paper proposes a novel approach to address this challenge by
developing controllable diffusion models for medical image synthesis, called
EMIT-Diff. We leverage recent diffusion probabilistic models to generate
realistic and diverse synthetic medical image data that preserve the essential
characteristics of the original medical images by incorporating edge
information of objects to guide the synthesis process. In our approach, we
ensure that the synthesized samples adhere to medically relevant constraints
and preserve the underlying structure of imaging data. Due to the random
sampling process by the diffusion model, we can generate an arbitrary number of
synthetic images with diverse appearances. To validate the effectiveness of our
proposed method, we conduct an extensive set of medical image segmentation
experiments on multiple datasets, including Ultrasound breast (+13.87%), CT
spleen (+0.38%), and MRI prostate (+7.78%), achieving significant improvements
over the baseline segmentation methods. For the first time, to our best
knowledge, the promising results demonstrate the effectiveness of our EMIT-Diff
for medical image segmentation tasks and show the feasibility of introducing a
first-ever text-guided diffusion model for general medical image segmentation
tasks. With carefully designed ablation experiments, we investigate the
influence of various data augmentation ratios, hyper-parameter settings, patch
size for generating random merging mask settings, and combined influence with
different network architectures.

<li>Summary: <p>Score-based generative models (SGMs) sample from a target distribution by
iteratively transforming noise using the score function of the perturbed
target. For any finite training set, this score function can be evaluated in
closed form, but the resulting SGM memorizes its training data and does not
generate novel samples. In practice, one approximates the score by training a
neural network via score-matching. The error in this approximation promotes
generalization, but neural SGMs are costly to train and sample, and the
effective regularization this error provides is not well-understood
theoretically. In this work, we instead explicitly smooth the closed-form score
to obtain an SGM that generates novel samples without training. We analyze our
model and propose an efficient nearest-neighbor-based estimator of its score
function. Using this estimator, our method achieves sampling times competitive
with neural SGMs while running on consumer-grade CPUs.

<li>Summary: <p>With evolving data regulations, machine unlearning (MU) has become an
important tool for fostering trust and safety in today's AI models. However,
existing MU methods focusing on data and/or weight perspectives often grapple
with limitations in unlearning accuracy, stability, and cross-domain
applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of 'weight
saliency' in MU, drawing parallels with input saliency in model explanation.
This innovation directs MU's attention toward specific model weights rather
than the entire model, improving effectiveness and efficiency. The resultant
method that we call saliency unlearning (SalUn) narrows the performance gap
with 'exact' unlearning (model retraining from scratch after removing the
forgetting dataset). To the best of our knowledge, SalUn is the first
principled MU approach adaptable enough to effectively erase the influence of
forgetting data, classes, or concepts in both image classification and
generation. For example, SalUn yields a stability advantage in high-variance
random data forgetting, e.g., with a 0.2% gap compared to exact unlearning on
the CIFAR-10 dataset. Moreover, in preventing conditional diffusion models from
generating harmful images, SalUn achieves nearly 100% unlearning accuracy,
outperforming current state-of-the-art baselines like Erased Stable Diffusion
and Forget-Me-Not.

<li>Summary: <p>Recent advances in whole-slide image (WSI) scanners and computational
capabilities have significantly propelled the application of artificial
intelligence in histopathology slide analysis. While these strides are
promising, current supervised learning approaches for WSI analysis come with
the challenge of exhaustively labeling high-resolution slides - a process that
is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. In contrast, self-supervised
learning (SSL) pretraining strategies are emerging as a viable alternative,
given that they don't rely on explicit data annotations. These SSL strategies
are quickly bridging the performance disparity with their supervised
counterparts. In this context, we introduce an SSL framework. This framework
aims for transferable representation learning and semantically meaningful
clustering by synergizing invariance loss and clustering loss in WSI analysis.
Notably, our approach outperforms common SSL methods in downstream
classification and clustering tasks, as evidenced by tests on the Camelyon16
and a pancreatic cancer dataset. The code and additional details are accessible

<li>Summary: <p>Deep Learning models have shown remarkable performance in a broad range of
vision tasks. However, they are often vulnerable against domain shifts at
test-time. Test-time training (TTT) methods have been developed in an attempt
to mitigate these vulnerabilities, where a secondary task is solved at training
time simultaneously with the main task, to be later used as an self-supervised
proxy task at test-time. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised TTT
technique based on the maximization of Mutual Information between multi-scale
feature maps and a discrete latent representation, which can be integrated to
the standard training as an auxiliary clustering task. Experimental results
demonstrate competitive classification performance on different popular
test-time adaptation benchmarks.

<li>Summary: <p>As Segment Anything Model (SAM) becomes a popular foundation model in
computer vision, its adversarial robustness has become a concern that cannot be
ignored. This works investigates whether it is possible to attack SAM with
image-agnostic Universal Adversarial Perturbation (UAP). In other words, we
seek a single perturbation that can fool the SAM to predict invalid masks for
most (if not all) images. We demonstrate convetional image-centric attack
framework is effective for image-independent attacks but fails for universal
adversarial attack. To this end, we propose a novel perturbation-centric
framework that results in a UAP generation method based on self-supervised
contrastive learning (CL), where the UAP is set to the anchor sample and the
positive sample is augmented from the UAP. The representations of negative
samples are obtained from the image encoder in advance and saved in a memory
bank. The effectiveness of our proposed CL-based UAP generation method is
validated by both quantitative and qualitative results. On top of the ablation
study to understand various components in our proposed method, we shed light on
the roles of positive and negative samples in making the generated UAP
effective for attacking SAM.

<li>Summary: <p>Image classification is a crucial task in modern weed management and crop
intervention technologies. However, the limited size, diversity, and balance of
existing weed datasets hinder the development of deep learning models for
generalizable weed identification. In addition, the expensive labelling
requirements of mainstream fully-supervised weed classifiers make them cost-
and time-prohibitive to deploy widely, for new weed species, and in
site-specific weed management. This paper proposes a novel method for Weed
Contrastive Learning through visual Representations (WeedCLR), that uses
class-optimized loss with Von Neumann Entropy of deep representation for weed
classification in long-tailed datasets. WeedCLR leverages self-supervised
learning to learn rich and robust visual features without any labels and
applies a class-optimized loss function to address the class imbalance problem
in long-tailed datasets. WeedCLR is evaluated on two public weed datasets:
CottonWeedID15, containing 15 weed species, and DeepWeeds, containing 8 weed
species. WeedCLR achieves an average accuracy improvement of 4.3\% on
CottonWeedID15 and 5.6\% on DeepWeeds over previous methods. It also
demonstrates better generalization ability and robustness to different
environmental conditions than existing methods without the need for expensive
and time-consuming human annotations. These significant improvements make
WeedCLR an effective tool for weed classification in long-tailed datasets and
allows for more rapid and widespread deployment of site-specific weed

<li>Summary: <p>Ultrasound is the primary imaging modality in clinical practice during
pregnancy. More than 140M fetuses are born yearly, resulting in numerous scans.
The availability of a large volume of fetal ultrasound scans presents the
opportunity to train robust machine learning models. However, the abundance of
scans also has its challenges, as manual labeling of each image is needed for
supervised methods. Labeling is typically labor-intensive and requires
expertise to annotate the images accurately. This study presents an
unsupervised approach for automatically clustering ultrasound images into a
large range of fetal views, reducing or eliminating the need for manual
labeling. Our Fetal Ultrasound Semantic Clustering (FUSC) method is developed
using a large dataset of 88,063 images and further evaluated on an additional
unseen dataset of 8,187 images achieving over 92% clustering purity. The result
of our investigation hold the potential to significantly impact the field of
fetal ultrasound imaging and pave the way for more advanced automated labeling
solutions. Finally, we make the code and the experimental setup publicly

<li>Summary: <p>We present Consistent Assignment of Views over Random Partitions (CARP), a
self-supervised clustering method for representation learning of visual
features. CARP learns prototypes in an end-to-end online fashion using gradient
descent without additional non-differentiable modules to solve the cluster
assignment problem. CARP optimizes a new pretext task based on random
partitions of prototypes that regularizes the model and enforces consistency
between views' assignments. Additionally, our method improves training
stability and prevents collapsed solutions in joint-embedding training. Through
an extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that CARP's representations are
suitable for learning downstream tasks. We evaluate CARP's representations
capabilities in 17 datasets across many standard protocols, including linear
evaluation, few-shot classification, k-NN, k-means, image retrieval, and copy
detection. We compare CARP performance to 11 existing self-supervised methods.
We extensively ablate our method and demonstrate that our proposed random
partition pretext task improves the quality of the learned representations by
devising multiple random classification tasks. In transfer learning tasks, CARP
achieves the best performance on average against many SSL methods trained for a

LLMs, because of their large size and pretraining on large volumes of text

popularity of LLMs is increasing exponentially after the introduction of models
like ChatGPT and GPT4. We refer to GPT-3 and its successor OpenAI models,
including ChatGPT and GPT4, as GPT-3 family large language models (GLLMs). With
the ever-rising popularity of GLLMs, especially in the research community,
there is a strong need for a comprehensive survey which summarizes the recent
research progress in multiple dimensions and can guide the research community
with insightful future research directions. We start the survey paper with
foundation concepts like transformers, transfer learning, self-supervised

<li>Summary: <p>Medical time series data are indispensable in healthcare, providing critical
insights for disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient management. The
exponential growth in data complexity, driven by advanced sensor technologies,
has presented challenges related to data labeling. Self-supervised learning
(SSL) has emerged as a transformative approach to address these challenges,
eliminating the need for extensive human annotation. In this study, we
introduce a novel framework for Medical Time Series Representation Learning,
known as MTS-LOF. MTS-LOF leverages the strengths of contrastive learning and
Masked Autoencoder (MAE) methods, offering a unique approach to representation
learning for medical time series data. By combining these techniques, MTS-LOF
enhances the potential of healthcare applications by providing more
sophisticated, context-rich representations. Additionally, MTS-LOF employs a
multi-masking strategy to facilitate occlusion-invariant feature learning. This
approach allows the model to create multiple views of the data by masking
portions of it. By minimizing the discrepancy between the representations of
these masked patches and the fully visible patches, MTS-LOF learns to capture
rich contextual information within medical time series datasets. The results of
experiments conducted on diverse medical time series datasets demonstrate the
superiority of MTS-LOF over other methods. These findings hold promise for
significantly enhancing healthcare applications by improving representation
learning. Furthermore, our work delves into the integration of joint-embedding
SSL and MAE techniques, shedding light on the intricate interplay between
temporal and structural dependencies in healthcare data. This understanding is
crucial, as it allows us to grasp the complexities of healthcare data analysis.

<li>Summary: <p>We introduce Cosmos, a framework for object-centric world modeling that is
designed for compositional generalization (CG), i.e., high performance on
unseen input scenes obtained through the composition of known visual "atoms."
The central insight behind Cosmos is the use of a novel form of neurosymbolic
grounding. Specifically, the framework introduces two new tools: (i)
neurosymbolic scene encodings, which represent each entity in a scene using a
real vector computed using a neural encoder, as well as a vector of composable
symbols describing attributes of the entity, and (ii) a neurosymbolic attention
mechanism that binds these entities to learned rules of interaction. Cosmos is
end-to-end differentiable; also, unlike traditional neurosymbolic methods that
require representations to be manually mapped to symbols, it computes an
entity's symbolic attributes using vision-language foundation models. Through
an evaluation that considers two different forms of CG on an established
blocks-pushing domain, we show that the framework establishes a new
state-of-the-art for CG in world modeling.

a regularization term on generative adversarial networks. Similarity constraint
works as a tutor to instruct the generator network to comprehend the difference
of representations based on conditions. We understand how SCGAN works on a
deeper level. This understanding makes us realize that the similarity
constraint functions like the contrastive loss function. We believe that a
model with high understanding and intelligence measures the similarity between
images based on their structure and high level features, just like humans do.
Two major changes we applied to SCGAN in order to make a modified model are
using SSIM to measure similarity between images and applying contrastive loss
principles to the similarity constraint. The modified model performs better
using FID and FactorVAE metrics. The modified model also has better
generalisability compared to other models. Keywords Generative Adversarial

<li>Summary: <p>Classical techniques for protecting facial image privacy typically fall into
two categories: data-poisoning methods, exemplified by Fawkes, which introduce
subtle perturbations to images, or anonymization methods that generate images
resembling the original only in several characteristics, such as gender,
ethnicity, or facial expression.In this study, we introduce a novel approach,
PrivacyGAN, that uses the power of image generation techniques, such as VQGAN
and StyleGAN, to safeguard privacy while maintaining image usability,
particularly for social media applications. Drawing inspiration from Fawkes,
our method entails shifting the original image within the embedding space
towards a decoy image.We evaluate our approach using privacy metrics on
traditional and novel facial image datasets. Additionally, we propose new
criteria for evaluating the robustness of privacy-protection methods against
unknown image recognition techniques, and we demonstrate that our approach is
effective even in unknown embedding transfer scenarios. We also provide a human
evaluation that further proves that the modified image preserves its utility as
it remains recognisable as an image of the same person by friends and family.

<li>Summary: <p>We present REMARK-LLM, a novel efficient, and robust watermarking framework
designed for texts generated by large language models (LLMs). Synthesizing
human-like content using LLMs necessitates vast computational resources and
extensive datasets, encapsulating critical intellectual property (IP). However,
the generated content is prone to malicious exploitation, including spamming
and plagiarism. To address the challenges, REMARK-LLM proposes three new
components: (i) a learning-based message encoding module to infuse binary
signatures into LLM-generated texts; (ii) a reparameterization module to
transform the dense distributions from the message encoding to the sparse
distribution of the watermarked textual tokens; (iii) a decoding module
dedicated for signature extraction; Furthermore, we introduce an optimized beam
search algorithm to guarantee the coherence and consistency of the generated
content. REMARK-LLM is rigorously trained to encourage the preservation of
semantic integrity in watermarked content, while ensuring effective watermark
retrieval. Extensive evaluations on multiple unseen datasets highlight
REMARK-LLM proficiency and transferability in inserting 2 times more signature
bits into the same texts when compared to prior art, all while maintaining
semantic integrity. Furthermore, REMARK-LLM exhibits better resilience against
a spectrum of watermark detection and removal attacks.

<li>Summary: <p>The paper proposes a framework that combines behavioral and computational
experiments employing fictional prompts as a novel tool for investigating
cultural artifacts and social biases in storytelling both by humans and
generative AI. The study analyzes 250 stories authored by crowdworkers in June
2019 and 80 stories generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in March 2023 by merging
methods from narratology and inferential statistics. Both crowdworkers and
large language models responded to identical prompts about creating and falling
in love with an artificial human. The proposed experimental paradigm allows a
direct comparison between human and LLM-generated storytelling. Responses to
the Pygmalionesque prompts confirm the pervasive presence of the Pygmalion myth
in the collective imaginary of both humans and large language models. All
solicited narratives present a scientific or technological pursuit. The
analysis reveals that narratives from GPT-3.5 and particularly GPT-4 are more
more progressive in terms of gender roles and sexuality than those written by
humans. While AI narratives can occasionally provide innovative plot twists,
they offer less imaginative scenarios and rhetoric than human-authored texts.
The proposed framework argues that fiction can be used as a window into human
and AI-based collective imaginary and social dimensions.

<li>Summary: <p>The generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools based on Large Language
Models (LLMs) use billions of parameters to extensively analyse large datasets
and extract critical private information such as, context, specific details,
identifying information etc. This have raised serious threats to user privacy
and reluctance to use such tools. This article proposes the conceptual model
called PrivChatGPT, a privacy-preserving model for LLMs that consists of two
main components i.e., preserving user privacy during the data
curation/pre-processing together with preserving private context and the
private training process for large-scale data. To demonstrate its
applicability, we show how a private mechanism could be integrated into the
existing model for training LLMs to protect user privacy; specifically, we
employed differential privacy and private training using Reinforcement Learning
(RL). We measure the privacy loss and evaluate the measure of uncertainty or
randomness once differential privacy is applied. It further recursively
evaluates the level of privacy guarantees and the measure of uncertainty of
public database and resources, during each update when new information is added
for training purposes. To critically evaluate the use of differential privacy
for private LLMs, we hypothetically compared other mechanisms e..g, Blockchain,
private information retrieval, randomisation, for various performance measures
such as the model performance and accuracy, computational complexity, privacy
vs. utility etc. We conclude that differential privacy, randomisation, and
obfuscation can impact utility and performance of trained models, conversely,
the use of ToR, Blockchain, and PIR may introduce additional computational
complexity and high training latency. We believe that the proposed model could
be used as a benchmark for proposing privacy preserving LLMs for generative AI
tools.

<li>Summary: <p>This work reveals an evidential signal that emerges from the uncertainty
value in Evidential Deep Learning (EDL). EDL is one example of a class of
uncertainty-aware deep learning approaches designed to provide confidence (or
epistemic uncertainty) about the current test sample. In particular for
computer vision and bidirectional encoder large language models, the
<code>evidential signal' arising from the Dirichlet strength in EDL can, in some
cases, discriminate between classes, which is particularly strong when using
large language models. We hypothesise that the KL regularisation term causes
EDL to couple aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. In this paper, we
empirically investigate the correlations between misclassification and
evaluated uncertainty, and show that EDL's</code>evidential signal' is due to
misclassification bias. We critically evaluate EDL with other Dirichlet-based
approaches, namely Generative Evidential Neural Networks (EDL-GEN) and Prior
Networks, and show theoretically and empirically the differences between these
loss functions. We conclude that EDL's coupling of uncertainty arises from
these differences due to the use (or lack) of out-of-distribution samples
during training.

<li>Summary: <p>Given the ubiquitous use of tabular data in industries and the growing
concerns in data privacy and security, tabular data synthesis emerges as a
critical research area. The recent state-of-the-art methods show that large
language models (LLMs) can be adopted to generate realistic tabular data. As
LLMs pre-process tabular data as full text, they have the advantage of avoiding
the curse of dimensionality associated with one-hot encoding high-dimensional
data. However, their long training time and limited re-usability on new tasks
prevent them from replacing exiting tabular generative models. In this paper,
we propose Tabula, a tabular data synthesizer based on the language model
structure. Through Tabula, we demonstrate the inherent limitation of employing
pre-trained language models designed for natural language processing (NLP) in
the context of tabular data synthesis. Our investigation delves into the
development of a dedicated foundational model tailored specifically for tabular
data synthesis. Additionally, we propose a token sequence compression strategy
to significantly reduce training time while preserving the quality of synthetic
data. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that using a language
model structure without loading the well-trained model weights yields a better
starting model for tabular data synthesis. Moreover, the Tabula model,
previously trained on other tabular data, serves as an excellent foundation
model for new tabular data synthesis tasks. Additionally, the token sequence
compression method substantially reduces the model's training time. Results
show that Tabula averagely reduces 46.2% training time per epoch comparing to
current LLMs-based state-of-the-art algorithm and consistently achieves even
higher synthetic data utility.

<li>Summary: <p>Adaptable models could greatly benefit robotic agents operating in the real
world, allowing them to deal with novel and varying conditions. While
approaches such as Bayesian inference are well-studied frameworks for adapting
models to evidence, we build on recent advances in deep generative models which
have greatly affected many areas of robotics. Harnessing modern GPU
acceleration, we investigate how to quickly adapt the sample generation of
neural network models to observations in robotic tasks. We propose a simple and
general method that is applicable to various deep generative models and robotic
environments. The key idea is to quickly fine-tune the model by fitting it to
generated samples matching the observed evidence, using the cross-entropy
method. We show that our method can be applied to both autoregressive models
and variational autoencoders, and demonstrate its usability in object shape
inference from grasping, inverse kinematics calculation, and point cloud
completion.

<li>Summary: <p>Open-set supervised anomaly detection (OSAD) - a recently emerging anomaly
detection area - aims at utilizing a few samples of anomaly classes seen during
training to detect unseen anomalies (i.e., samples from open-set anomaly
classes), while effectively identifying the seen anomalies. Benefiting from the
prior knowledge illustrated by the seen anomalies, current OSAD methods can
often largely reduce false positive errors. However, these methods treat the
anomaly examples as from a homogeneous distribution, rendering them less
effective in generalizing to unseen anomalies that can be drawn from any
distribution. In this paper, we propose to learn heterogeneous anomaly
distributions using the limited anomaly examples to address this issue. To this
end, we introduce a novel approach, namely Anomaly Heterogeneity Learning
(AHL), that simulates a diverse set of heterogeneous (seen and unseen) anomaly
distributions and then utilizes them to learn a unified heterogeneous
abnormality model. Further, AHL is a generic framework that existing OSAD
models can plug and play for enhancing their abnormality modeling. Extensive
experiments on nine real-world anomaly detection datasets show that AHL can 1)
substantially enhance different state-of-the-art (SOTA) OSAD models in
detecting both seen and unseen anomalies, achieving new SOTA performance on a
large set of datasets, and 2) effectively generalize to unseen anomalies in new
target domains.

<li>Summary: <p>Numerous methods for time series anomaly detection (TSAD) methods have
emerged in recent years. Most existing methods are unsupervised and assume the
availability of normal training samples only, while few supervised methods have
shown superior performance by incorporating labeled anomalous samples in the
training phase. However, certain anomaly types are inherently challenging for
unsupervised methods to differentiate from normal data, while supervised
methods are constrained to detecting anomalies resembling those present during
training, failing to generalize to unseen anomaly classes. This paper is the
first attempt in providing a novel approach for the open-set TSAD problem, in
which a small number of labeled anomalies from a limited class of anomalies are
visible in the training phase, with the objective of detecting both seen and
unseen anomaly classes in the test phase. The proposed method, called
Multivariate Open-Set timeseries Anomaly Detection (MOSAD) consists of three
primary modules: a Feature Extractor to extract meaningful time-series
features; a Multi-head Network consisting of Generative-, Deviation-, and
Contrastive heads for capturing both seen and unseen anomaly classes; and an
Anomaly Scoring module leveraging the insights of the three heads to detect
anomalies. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets consistently show
that our approach surpasses existing methods under various experimental
settings, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art performance in the TSAD
field.

<li>Summary: <p>In-context learning (ICL) is a new learning paradigm that has gained
popularity along with the development of large language models. In this work,
we adapt a recently proposed hardness metric, pointwise $\mathcal{V}$-usable
information (PVI), to an in-context version (in-context PVI). Compared to the
original PVI, in-context PVI is more efficient in that it requires only a few
exemplars and does not require fine-tuning. We conducted a comprehensive
empirical analysis to evaluate the reliability of in-context PVI. Our findings
indicate that in-context PVI estimates exhibit similar characteristics to the
original PVI. Specific to the in-context setting, we show that in-context PVI
estimates remain consistent across different exemplar selections and numbers of
shots. The variance of in-context PVI estimates across different exemplar
selections is insignificant, which suggests that in-context PVI are stable.
Furthermore, we demonstrate how in-context PVI can be employed to identify
challenging instances. Our work highlights the potential of in-context PVI and
provides new insights into the capabilities of ICL.

<li>Summary: <p>Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to red teaming attacks, which
can induce LLMs to generate harmful content. Previous research constructs
attack prompts via manual or automatic methods, which have their own
limitations on construction cost and quality. To address these issues, we
propose an integrated approach that combines manual and automatic methods to
economically generate high-quality attack prompts. Specifically, considering
the impressive capabilities of newly emerged LLMs, we propose an attack
framework to instruct LLMs to mimic human-generated prompts through in-context
learning. Furthermore, we propose a defense framework that fine-tunes victim
LLMs through iterative interactions with the attack framework to enhance their
safety against red teaming attacks. Extensive experiments on different LLMs
validate the effectiveness of our proposed attack and defense frameworks.
Additionally, we release a series of attack prompts datasets named SAP with
varying sizes, facilitating the safety evaluation and enhancement of more LLMs.

<li>Summary: <p>E-commerce applications such as faceted product search or product comparison
are based on structured product descriptions like attribute/value pairs. The
vendors on e-commerce platforms do not provide structured product descriptions
but describe offers using titles or descriptions. To process such offers, it is
necessary to extract attribute/value pairs from textual product attributes.
State-of-the-art attribute/value extraction techniques rely on pre-trained
language models (PLMs), such as BERT. Two major drawbacks of these models for
attribute/value extraction are that (i) the models require significant amounts
of task-specific training data and (ii) the fine-tuned models face challenges
in generalizing to attribute values not included in the training data. This
paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) as a training
data-efficient and robust alternative to PLM-based attribute/value extraction
methods. We consider hosted LLMs, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as well as
open-source LLMs based on Llama2. We evaluate the models in a zero-shot
scenario and in a scenario where task-specific training data is available. In
the zero-shot scenario, we compare various prompt designs for representing
information about the target attributes of the extraction. In the scenario with
training data, we investigate (i) the provision of example attribute values,
(ii) the selection of in-context demonstrations, and (iii) the fine-tuning of
GPT-3.5. Our experiments show that GPT-4 achieves an average F1-score of 85% on
the two evaluation datasets while the best PLM-based techniques perform on
average 5% worse using the same amount of training data. GPT-4 achieves a 10%
higher F1-score than the best open-source LLM. The fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model
reaches a similar performance as GPT-4 while being significantly more
cost-efficient.

<li>Summary: <p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited considerable cross-lingual
generalization abilities, whereby they implicitly transfer knowledge across
languages. However, the transfer is not equally successful for all languages,
especially for low-resource ones, which poses an ongoing challenge. It is
unclear whether we have reached the limits of implicit cross-lingual
generalization and if explicit knowledge transfer is viable. In this paper, we
investigate the potential for explicitly aligning conceptual correspondence
between languages to enhance cross-lingual generalization. Using the syntactic
aspect of language as a testbed, our analyses of 43 languages reveal a high
degree of alignability among the spaces of structural concepts within each
language for both encoder-only and decoder-only LLMs. We then propose a
meta-learning-based method to learn to align conceptual spaces of different
languages, which facilitates zero-shot and few-shot generalization in concept
classification and also offers insights into the cross-lingual in-context
learning phenomenon. Experiments on syntactic analysis tasks show that our
approach achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art methods and narrows
the performance gap between languages, particularly benefiting those with
limited resources.

<li>Summary: <p>Recently efforts have been made by social media platforms as well as
researchers to detect hateful or toxic language using large language models.
However, none of these works aim to use explanation, additional context and
victim community information in the detection process. We utilise different
prompt variation, input information and evaluate large language models in zero
shot setting (without adding any in-context examples). We select three large
language models (GPT-3.5, text-davinci and Flan-T5) and three datasets -
HateXplain, implicit hate and ToxicSpans. We find that on average including the
target information in the pipeline improves the model performance substantially
(~20-30%) over the baseline across the datasets. There is also a considerable
effect of adding the rationales/explanations into the pipeline (~10-20%) over
the baseline across the datasets. In addition, we further provide a typology of
the error cases where these large language models fail to (i) classify and (ii)
explain the reason for the decisions they take. Such vulnerable points
automatically constitute 'jailbreak' prompts for these models and industry
scale safeguard techniques need to be developed to make the models robust
against such prompts.

<li>Summary: <p>Historical maps provide useful spatio-temporal information on the Earth's
surface before modern earth observation techniques came into being. To extract
information from maps, neural networks, which gain wide popularity in recent
years, have replaced hand-crafted map processing methods and tedious manual
labor. However, aleatoric uncertainty, known as data-dependent uncertainty,
inherent in the drawing/scanning/fading defects of the original map sheets and
inadequate contexts when cropping maps into small tiles considering the memory
limits of the training process, challenges the model to make correct
predictions. As aleatoric uncertainty cannot be reduced even with more training
data collected, we argue that complementary spatio-temporal contexts can be
helpful. To achieve this, we propose a U-Net-based network that fuses
spatio-temporal features with cross-attention transformers (U-SpaTem),
aggregating information at a larger spatial range as well as through a temporal
sequence of images. Our model achieves a better performance than other
state-or-art models that use either temporal or spatial contexts. Compared with
pure vision transformers, our model is more lightweight and effective. To the
best of our knowledge, leveraging both spatial and temporal contexts have been
rarely explored before in the segmentation task. Even though our application is
on segmenting historical maps, we believe that the method can be transferred
into other fields with similar problems like temporal sequences of satellite
images. Our code is freely accessible at

<li>Summary: <p>Whole-slide image analysis via the means of computational pathology often
relies on processing tessellated gigapixel images with only slide-level labels
available. Applying multiple instance learning-based methods or transformer
models is computationally expensive as, for each image, all instances have to
be processed simultaneously. The MLP-Mixer is an under-explored alternative
model to common vision transformers, especially for large-scale datasets. Due
to the lack of a self-attention mechanism, they have linear computational
complexity to the number of input patches but achieve comparable performance on
natural image datasets. We propose a combination of feature embedding and
clustering to preprocess the full whole-slide image into a reduced prototype
representation which can then serve as input to a suitable MLP-Mixer
architecture. Our experiments on two public benchmarks and one inhouse
malignant lymphoma dataset show comparable performance to current
state-of-the-art methods, while achieving lower training costs in terms of
computational time and memory load. Code is publicly available at

<li>Summary: <p>Spatial reasoning in text plays a crucial role in various real-world
applications. Existing approaches for spatial reasoning typically infer spatial
relations from pure text, which overlook the gap between natural language and
symbolic structures. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have showcased exceptional
proficiency in inducing and aggregating symbolic structures. However, classical
GNNs face challenges in handling multi-hop spatial reasoning due to the
over-smoothing issue, \textit{i.e.}, the performance decreases substantially as
the number of graph layers increases. To cope with these challenges, we propose
a novel \textbf{Dep}th-\textbf{Wi}se \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}eural
\textbf{N}etwork (\textbf{DepWiGNN}). Specifically, we design a novel node
memory scheme and aggregate the information over the depth dimension instead of
the breadth dimension of the graph, which empowers the ability to collect long
dependencies without stacking multiple layers. Experimental results on two
challenging multi-hop spatial reasoning datasets show that DepWiGNN outperforms
existing spatial reasoning methods. The comparisons with the other three GNNs
further demonstrate its superiority in capturing long dependency in the graph.

<li>Summary: <p>Parameter-shared pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged as a
successful approach in resource-constrained environments, enabling substantial
reductions in model storage and memory costs without significant performance
compromise. However, it is important to note that parameter sharing does not
alleviate computational burdens associated with inference, thus impeding its
practicality in situations characterized by limited stringent latency
requirements or computational resources. Building upon neural ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), we introduce a straightforward technique to
enhance the inference efficiency of parameter-shared PLMs. Additionally, we
propose a simple pre-training technique that leads to fully or partially shared
models capable of achieving even greater inference acceleration. The
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on both
autoregressive and autoencoding PLMs, providing novel insights into more
efficient utilization of parameter-shared models in resource-constrained
settings.

<li>Summary: <p>Functional bootstrapping is a core technique in Fully Homomorphic Encryption
(FHE). For large plaintext, to evaluate a general function homomorphically over
a ciphertext, in the FHEW/TFHE approach, since the function in look-up table
form is encoded in the coefficients of a test polynomial, the degree of the
polynomial must be high enough to hold the entire table. This increases the
bootstrapping time complexity and memory cost, as the size of bootstrapping
keys and keyswitching keys need to be large accordingly. In this paper, we
propose to encode the look-up table of any function in a polynomial vector,
whose coefficients can hold more data. The corresponding representation of the
additive group Zq used in the RGSW-based bootstrapping is the group of monic
monomial permutation matrices, which integrates the permutation matrix
representation used by Alperin-Sheriff and Peikert in 2014, and the monic
monomial representation used in the FHEW/TFHE scheme. We make comprehensive
investigation of the new representation, and propose a new bootstrapping
algorithm based on it. The new algorithm has the prominent benefit of small
bootstrapping key size and small key-switching key size, which leads to
polynomial factor improvement in key size, in addition to constant factor
improvement in run-time cost.

<li>Summary: <p>The average user has between 90-130 online accounts, and around $3 \times
10^{11}$ passwords are in use this year. Most people are terrible at
remembering "random" passwords, so they reuse or create similar passwords using
a combination of predictable words, numbers, and symbols. Previous
password-generation or management protocols have imposed so large a cognitive
load that users have abandoned them in favor of insecure yet simpler methods
(e.g., writing them down or reusing minor variants).
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We describe a range of candidate human-computable "hash" functions suitable
for use as password generators - as long as the human (with minimal education
assumptions) keeps a single, easily-memorizable "master" secret - and rate them
by various metrics, including effective security.
</p>
<p>These functions hash master-secrets with user accounts to produce sub-secrets
that can be used as passwords; $F_R($s$, w) \longrightarrow y$, takes a website
$w$, produces a password $y$, parameterized by master secret $s$, which may or
may not be a string.
</p>
<p>We exploit the unique configuration $R$ of each user's associative and
implicit memory (detailed in section 2) to ensure that sources of randomness
unique to each user are present in each master-secret $F_R$. An adversary
cannot compute or verify $F_R$ efficiently since $R$ is unique to each
individual; in that sense, our hash function is similar to a physically
unclonable function. For the algorithms we propose, the user need only complete
primitive operations such as addition, spatial navigation or searching.
Critically, most of our methods are also accessible to neurodiverse, or
cognitively or physically differently-abled persons.
</p>
<p>We present results from a survey (n=134 individuals) investigating real-world
usage of these methods and how people currently come up with their passwords,
we also survey 400 websites to collate current password advice.

<li>Summary: <p>Domain incremental learning aims to adapt to a sequence of domains with
access to only a small subset of data (i.e., memory) from previous domains.
Various methods have been proposed for this problem, but it is still unclear
how they are related and when practitioners should choose one method over
another. In response, we propose a unified framework, dubbed Unified Domain
Incremental Learning (UDIL), for domain incremental learning with memory. Our
UDIL <strong>unifies</strong> various existing methods, and our theoretical analysis shows
that UDIL always achieves a tighter generalization error bound compared to
these methods. The key insight is that different existing methods correspond to
our bound with different <strong>fixed</strong> coefficients; based on insights from this
unification, our UDIL allows <strong>adaptive</strong> coefficients during training, thereby
always achieving the tightest bound. Empirical results show that our UDIL
outperforms the state-of-the-art domain incremental learning methods on both
synthetic and real-world datasets. Code will be available at
https://github.com/Wang-ML-Lab/unified-continual-learning.

<li>Summary: <p>Few-shot segmentation (FSS) is proposed to segment unknown class targets with
just a few annotated samples. Most current FSS methods follow the paradigm of
mining the semantics from the support images to guide the query image
segmentation. However, such a pattern of <code>learning from others' struggles to
handle the extreme intra-class variation, preventing FSS from being directly
generalized to remote sensing scenes. To bridge the gap of intra-class
variance, we develop a Dual-Mining network named DMNet for cross-image mining
and self-mining, meaning that it no longer focuses solely on support images but
pays more attention to the query image itself. Specifically, we propose a
Class-public Region Mining (CPRM) module to effectively suppress irrelevant
feature pollution by capturing the common semantics between the support-query
image pair. The Class-specific Region Mining (CSRM) module is then proposed to
continuously mine the class-specific semantics of the query image itself in a</code>filtering' and `purifying' manner. In addition, to prevent the co-existence of
multiple classes in remote sensing scenes from exacerbating the collapse of FSS
generalization, we also propose a new Known-class Meta Suppressor (KMS) module
to suppress the activation of known-class objects in the sample. Extensive
experiments on the iSAID and LoveDA remote sensing datasets have demonstrated
that our method sets the state-of-the-art with a minimum number of model
parameters. Significantly, our model with the backbone of Resnet-50 achieves
the mIoU of 49.58% and 51.34% on iSAID under 1-shot and 5-shot settings,
outperforming the state-of-the-art method by 1.8% and 1.12%, respectively. The
code is publicly available at https://github.com/HanboBizl/DMNet.

<li>Summary: <p>Entity linking aims to link ambiguous mentions to their corresponding
entities in a knowledge base. One of the key challenges comes from insufficient
labeled data for specific domains. Although dense retrievers have achieved
excellent performance on several benchmarks, their performance decreases
significantly when only a limited amount of in-domain labeled data is
available. In such few-shot setting, we revisit the sparse retrieval method,
and propose an ELECTRA-based keyword extractor to denoise the mention context
and construct a better query expression. For training the extractor, we propose
a distant supervision method to automatically generate training data based on
overlapping tokens between mention contexts and entity descriptions.
Experimental results on the ZESHEL dataset demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art models by a significant margin across all test
domains, showing the effectiveness of keyword-enhanced sparse retrieval.

<li>Summary: <p>Prompt-based learning has been an effective paradigm for large pretrained
language models (LLM), enabling few-shot or even zero-shot learning. Black-box
prompt search has received growing interest recently for its distinctive
properties of gradient-free optimization, proven particularly useful and
powerful for model-as-a-service usage. However, the discrete nature and the
complexity of combinatorial optimization hinder the efficiency of modern
black-box approaches. Despite extensive research on search algorithms, the
crucial aspect of search space design and optimization has been largely
overlooked. In this paper, we first conduct a sensitivity analysis by prompting
LLM, revealing that only a small number of tokens exert a disproportionate
amount of influence on LLM predictions. Leveraging this insight, we propose the
Clustering and Pruning for Efficient Black-box Prompt Search (ClaPS), a simple
black-box search method that first clusters and prunes the search space to
focus exclusively on influential prompt tokens. By employing even simple search
methods within the pruned search space, ClaPS achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various tasks and LLMs, surpassing the performance of
complex approaches while significantly reducing search costs. Our findings
underscore the critical role of search space design and optimization in
enhancing both the usefulness and the efficiency of black-box prompt-based
learning.

<li>Summary: <p>Prompt-based learning has shown its effectiveness in few-shot text
classification. One important factor in its success is a verbalizer, which
translates output from a language model into a predicted class. Notably, the
simplest and widely acknowledged verbalizer employs manual labels to represent
the classes. However, manual selection does not guarantee the optimality of the
selected words when conditioned on the chosen language model. Therefore, we
propose Label-Aware Automatic Verbalizer (LAAV), effectively augmenting the
manual labels to achieve better few-shot classification results. Specifically,
we use the manual labels along with the conjunction "and" to induce the model
to generate more effective words for the verbalizer. The experimental results
on five datasets across five languages demonstrate that LAAV significantly
outperforms existing verbalizers. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that LAAV
suggests more relevant words compared to similar approaches, especially in
mid-to-low resource languages.
