<li>Summary: <p>Text-guided diffusion models have revolutionized image generation and
editing, offering exceptional realism and diversity. Specifically, in the
context of diffusion-based editing, where a source image is edited according to
a target prompt, the process commences by acquiring a noisy latent vector
corresponding to the source image via the diffusion model. This vector is
subsequently fed into separate source and target diffusion branches for
editing. The accuracy of this inversion process significantly impacts the final
editing outcome, influencing both essential content preservation of the source
image and edit fidelity according to the target prompt. Prior inversion
techniques aimed at finding a unified solution in both the source and target
diffusion branches. However, our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that
disentangling these branches leads to a distinct separation of responsibilities
for preserving essential content and ensuring edit fidelity. Building on this
insight, we introduce "Direct Inversion," a novel technique achieving optimal
performance of both branches with just three lines of code. To assess image
editing performance, we present PIE-Bench, an editing benchmark with 700 images
showcasing diverse scenes and editing types, accompanied by versatile
annotations and comprehensive evaluation metrics. Compared to state-of-the-art
optimization-based inversion techniques, our solution not only yields superior
performance across 8 editing methods but also achieves nearly an order of
speed-up.

<li>Summary: <p>Crowd counting is a critical task in computer vision, with several important
applications. However, existing counting methods rely on labor-intensive
density map annotations, necessitating the manual localization of each
individual pedestrian. While recent efforts have attempted to alleviate the
annotation burden through weakly or semi-supervised learning, these approaches
fall short of significantly reducing the workload. We propose a novel approach
to eliminate the annotation burden by leveraging latent diffusion models to
generate synthetic data. However, these models struggle to reliably understand
object quantities, leading to noisy annotations when prompted to produce images
with a specific quantity of objects. To address this, we use latent diffusion
models to create two types of synthetic data: one by removing pedestrians from
real images, which generates ranked image pairs with a weak but reliable object
quantity signal, and the other by generating synthetic images with a
predetermined number of objects, offering a strong but noisy counting signal.
Our method utilizes the ranking image pairs for pre-training and then fits a
linear layer to the noisy synthetic images using these crowd quantity features.
We report state-of-the-art results for unsupervised crowd counting.

<li>Summary: <p>Domain Adaptation (DA) is a method for enhancing a model's performance on a
target domain with inadequate annotated data by applying the information the
model has acquired from a related source domain with sufficient labeled data.
The escalating enforcement of data-privacy regulations like HIPAA, COPPA,
FERPA, etc. have sparked a heightened interest in adapting models to novel
domains while circumventing the need for direct access to the source data, a
problem known as Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA). In this paper, we
propose a novel framework for SFDA that generates source data using a
text-to-image diffusion model trained on the target domain samples. Our method
starts by training a text-to-image diffusion model on the labeled target domain
samples, which is then fine-tuned using the pre-trained source model to
generate samples close to the source data. Finally, we use Domain Adaptation
techniques to align the artificially generated source data with the target
domain data, resulting in significant performance improvements of the model on
the target domain. Through extensive comparison against several baselines on
the standard Office-31, Office-Home, and VisDA benchmarks, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach for the SFDA task.

<li>Summary: <p>Exploring a machine learning system to generate meaningful combinatorial
object images from multiple textual descriptions, emulating human creativity,
is a significant challenge as humans are able to construct amazing
combinatorial objects, but machines strive to emulate data distribution. In
this paper, we develop a straightforward yet highly effective technique called
acceptable swap-sampling to generate a combinatorial object image that exhibits
novelty and surprise, utilizing text concepts of different objects. Initially,
we propose a swapping mechanism that constructs a novel embedding by exchanging
column vectors of two text embeddings for generating a new combinatorial image
through a cutting-edge diffusion model. Furthermore, we design an acceptable
region by managing suitable CLIP distances between the new image and the
original concept generations, increasing the likelihood of accepting the new
image with a high-quality combination. This region allows us to efficiently
sample a small subset from a new image pool generated by using randomly
exchanging column vectors. Lastly, we employ a segmentation method to compare
CLIP distances among the segmented components, ultimately selecting the most
promising object image from the sampled subset. Our experiments focus on text
pairs of objects from ImageNet, and our results demonstrate that our approach
outperforms recent methods such as Stable-Diffusion2, DALLE2, ERNIE-ViLG2 and
Bing in generating novel and surprising object images, even when the associated
concepts appear to be implausible, such as lionfish-abacus. Furthermore, during
the sampling process, our approach without training and human preference is
also comparable to PickScore and HPSv2 trained using human preference datasets.

<li>Summary: <p>Text-To-Image (TTI) models, exemplified by DALL-E and StableDiffusion, have
recently gained prominence for their remarkable zero-shot capabilities in
generating images guided by textual prompts. Language, as a conduit of culture,
plays a pivotal role in these models' multilingual capabilities, which in turn
shape their cultural agency. In this study, we explore the cultural perception
embedded in TTI models by characterizing culture across three hierarchical
tiers: cultural dimensions, cultural domains, and cultural concepts. We propose
a comprehensive suite of evaluation techniques, including intrinsic evaluations
using the CLIP space, extrinsic evaluations with a Visual-Question-Answer (VQA)
model, and human assessments, to discern TTI cultural perceptions. To
facilitate our research, we introduce the CulText2I dataset, derived from four
diverse TTI models and spanning ten languages. Our experiments reveal insights
into these models' cultural awareness, cultural distinctions, and the unlocking
of cultural features, releasing the potential for cross-cultural applications.

<li>Summary: <p>Deep neural networks, despite their success in numerous applications, often
function without established theoretical foundations. In this paper, we bridge
this gap by drawing parallels between deep learning and classical numerical
analysis. By framing neural networks as operators with fixed points
representing desired solutions, we develop a theoretical framework grounded in
iterative methods for operator equations. Under defined conditions, we present
convergence proofs based on fixed point theory. We demonstrate that popular
architectures, such as diffusion models and AlphaFold, inherently employ
iterative operator learning. Empirical assessments highlight that performing
iterations through network operators improves performance. We also introduce an
iterative graph neural network, PIGN, that further demonstrates benefits of
iterations. Our work aims to enhance the understanding of deep learning by
merging insights from numerical analysis, potentially guiding the design of
future networks with clearer theoretical underpinnings and improved
performance.

<li>Summary: <p>There is a long history, as well as a recent explosion of interest, in
statistical and generative modeling approaches based on score functions --
derivatives of the log-likelihood of a distribution. In seminal works,
Hyv\"arinen proposed vanilla score matching as a way to learn distributions
from data by computing an estimate of the score function of the underlying
ground truth, and established connections between this method and established
techniques like Contrastive Divergence and Pseudolikelihood estimation. It is
by now well-known that vanilla score matching has significant difficulties
learning multimodal distributions. Although there are various ways to overcome
this difficulty, the following question has remained unanswered -- is there a
natural way to sample multimodal distributions using just the vanilla score?
Inspired by a long line of related experimental works, we prove that the
Langevin diffusion with early stopping, initialized at the empirical
distribution, and run on a score function estimated from data successfully
generates natural multimodal distributions (mixtures of log-concave
distributions).

<li>Summary: <p>In this paper, we introduce the Spectral Coefficient Learning via Operator
Network (SCLON), a novel operator learning-based approach for solving
parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) without the need for data
harnessing. The cornerstone of our method is the spectral methodology that
employs expansions using orthogonal functions, such as Fourier series and
Legendre polynomials, enabling accurate PDE solutions with fewer grid points.
By merging the merits of spectral methods - encompassing high accuracy,
efficiency, generalization, and the exact fulfillment of boundary conditions -
with the prowess of deep neural networks, SCLON offers a transformative
strategy. Our approach not only eliminates the need for paired input-output
training data, which typically requires extensive numerical computations, but
also effectively learns and predicts solutions of complex parametric PDEs,
ranging from singularly perturbed convection-diffusion equations to the
Navier-Stokes equations. The proposed framework demonstrates superior
performance compared to existing scientific machine learning techniques,
offering solutions for multiple instances of parametric PDEs without harnessing
data. The mathematical framework is robust and reliable, with a well-developed
loss function derived from the weak formulation, ensuring accurate
approximation of solutions while exactly satisfying boundary conditions. The
method's efficacy is further illustrated through its ability to accurately
predict intricate natural behaviors like the Kolmogorov flow and boundary
layers. In essence, our work pioneers a compelling avenue for parametric PDE
solutions, serving as a bridge between traditional numerical methodologies and
cutting-edge machine learning techniques in the realm of scientific
computation.

<li>Summary: <p>Colorectal cancer remains one of the deadliest cancers in the world. In
recent years computer-aided methods have aimed to enhance cancer screening and
improve the quality and availability of colonoscopies by automatizing
sub-tasks. One such task is predicting depth from monocular video frames, which
can assist endoscopic navigation. As ground truth depth from standard in-vivo
colonoscopy remains unobtainable due to hardware constraints, two approaches
have aimed to circumvent the need for real training data: supervised methods
trained on labeled synthetic data and self-supervised models trained on
unlabeled real data. However, self-supervised methods depend on unreliable loss
functions that struggle with edges, self-occlusion, and lighting inconsistency.
Methods trained on synthetic data can provide accurate depth for synthetic
geometries but do not use any geometric supervisory signal from real data and
overfit to synthetic anatomies and properties. This work proposes a novel
approach to leverage labeled synthetic and unlabeled real data. While previous
domain adaptation methods indiscriminately enforce the distributions of both
input data modalities to coincide, we focus on the end task, depth prediction,
and translate only essential information between the input domains. Our
approach results in more resilient and accurate depth maps of real colonoscopy
sequences.

<li>Summary: <p>Pretraining CNN models (i.e., UNet) through self-supervision has become a
powerful approach to facilitate medical image segmentation under low annotation
regimes. Recent contrastive learning methods encourage similar global
representations when the same image undergoes different transformations, or
enforce invariance across different image/patch features that are intrinsically
correlated. However, CNN-extracted global and local features are limited in
capturing long-range spatial dependencies that are essential in biological
anatomy. To this end, we present a keypoint-augmented fusion layer that
extracts representations preserving both short- and long-range self-attention.
In particular, we augment the CNN feature map at multiple scales by
incorporating an additional input that learns long-range spatial self-attention
among localized keypoint features. Further, we introduce both global and local
self-supervised pretraining for the framework. At the global scale, we obtain
global representations from both the bottleneck of the UNet, and by aggregating
multiscale keypoint features. These global features are subsequently
regularized through image-level contrastive objectives. At the local scale, we
define a distance-based criterion to first establish correspondences among
keypoints and encourage similarity between their features. Through extensive
experiments on both MRI and CT segmentation tasks, we demonstrate the
architectural advantages of our proposed method in comparison to both CNN and
Transformer-based UNets, when all architectures are trained with randomly
initialized weights. With our proposed pretraining strategy, our method further
outperforms existing SSL methods by producing more robust self-attention and
achieving state-of-the-art segmentation results. The code is available at

<li>Summary: <p>Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have shown impressive results for novel view
synthesis. However, they depend on the repetitive use of a single-input
single-output multilayer perceptron (SISO MLP) that maps 3D coordinates and
view direction to the color and volume density in a sample-wise manner, which
slows the rendering. We propose a multi-input multi-output NeRF (MIMO-NeRF)
that reduces the number of MLPs running by replacing the SISO MLP with a MIMO
MLP and conducting mappings in a group-wise manner. One notable challenge with
this approach is that the color and volume density of each point can differ
according to a choice of input coordinates in a group, which can lead to some
notable ambiguity. We also propose a self-supervised learning method that
regularizes the MIMO MLP with multiple fast reformulated MLPs to alleviate this
ambiguity without using pretrained models. The results of a comprehensive
experimental evaluation including comparative and ablation studies are
presented to show that MIMO-NeRF obtains a good trade-off between speed and
quality with a reasonable training time. We then demonstrate that MIMO-NeRF is
compatible with and complementary to previous advancements in NeRFs by applying
it to two representative fast NeRFs, i.e., a NeRF with sample reduction
(DONeRF) and a NeRF with alternative representations (TensoRF).

<li>Summary: <p>Merging multi-exposure images is a common approach for obtaining high dynamic
range (HDR) images, with the primary challenge being the avoidance of ghosting
artifacts in dynamic scenes. Recent methods have proposed using deep neural
networks for deghosting. However, the methods typically rely on sufficient data
with HDR ground-truths, which are difficult and costly to collect. In this
work, to eliminate the need for labeled data, we propose SelfHDR, a
self-supervised HDR reconstruction method that only requires dynamic
multi-exposure images during training. Specifically, SelfHDR learns a
reconstruction network under the supervision of two complementary components,
which can be constructed from multi-exposure images and focus on HDR color as
well as structure, respectively. The color component is estimated from aligned
multi-exposure images, while the structure one is generated through a
structure-focused network that is supervised by the color component and an
input reference (\eg, medium-exposure) image. During testing, the learned
reconstruction network is directly deployed to predict an HDR image.
Experiments on real-world images demonstrate our SelfHDR achieves superior
results against the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods, and comparable
performance to supervised ones. Codes are available at

<li>Summary: <p>The intersection of vision and language is of major interest due to the
increased focus on seamless integration between recognition and reasoning.
Scene graphs (SGs) have emerged as a useful tool for multimodal image analysis,
showing impressive performance in tasks such as Visual Question Answering
(VQA). In this work, we demonstrate that despite the effectiveness of scene
graphs in VQA tasks, current methods that utilize idealized annotated scene
graphs struggle to generalize when using predicted scene graphs extracted from
images. To address this issue, we introduce the SelfGraphVQA framework. Our
approach extracts a scene graph from an input image using a pre-trained scene
graph generator and employs semantically-preserving augmentation with
self-supervised techniques. This method improves the utilization of graph
representations in VQA tasks by circumventing the need for costly and
potentially biased annotated data. By creating alternative views of the
extracted graphs through image augmentations, we can learn joint embeddings by
optimizing the informational content in their representations using an
un-normalized contrastive approach. As we work with SGs, we experiment with
three distinct maximization strategies: node-wise, graph-wise, and
permutation-equivariant regularization. We empirically showcase the
effectiveness of the extracted scene graph for VQA and demonstrate that these
approaches enhance overall performance by highlighting the significance of
visual information. This offers a more practical solution for VQA tasks that
rely on SGs for complex reasoning questions.

<li>Summary: <p>Multiple object tracking (MOT) is a fundamental component of perception
systems for autonomous driving, and its robustness to unseen conditions is a
requirement to avoid life-critical failures. Despite the urge of safety in
driving systems, no solution to the MOT adaptation problem to domain shift in
test-time conditions has ever been proposed. However, the nature of a MOT
system is manifold - requiring object detection and instance association - and
adapting all its components is non-trivial. In this paper, we analyze the
effect of domain shift on appearance-based trackers, and introduce DARTH, a
holistic test-time adaptation framework for MOT. We propose a detection
consistency formulation to adapt object detection in a self-supervised fashion,
while adapting the instance appearance representations via our novel patch
contrastive loss. We evaluate our method on a variety of domain shifts -

improve the source model performance on all metrics. Code:

<li>Summary: <p>Masked AutoEncoder(MAE) has revolutionized the field of self-supervised
learning with its simple yet effective masking and reconstruction strategies.
However, despite achieving state-of-the-art performance across various
downstream vision tasks, the underlying mechanisms that drive MAE's efficacy
are less well-explored compared to the canonical contrastive learning paradigm.
In this paper, we explore a new perspective to explain what truly contributes
to the "rich hidden representations inside the MAE". Firstly, concerning MAE's
generative pretraining pathway, with a unique encoder-decoder architecture to
reconstruct images from aggressive masking, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
the decoder's behaviors. We empirically find that MAE's decoder mainly learns
local features with a limited receptive field, adhering to the well-known
Locality Principle. Building upon this locality assumption, we propose a
theoretical framework that reformulates the reconstruction-based MAE into a
local region-level contrastive learning form for improved understanding.
Furthermore, to substantiate the local contrastive nature of MAE, we introduce
a Siamese architecture that combines the essence of MAE and contrastive
learning without masking and explicit decoder, which sheds light on a unified
and more flexible self-supervised learning framework.

<li>Summary: <p>While self-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms have been widely used to

overfitting, and catastrophic forgetting problems for multi-task/dataset
learning in MUSCLE.We evaluate MUSCLE using 9 real-world X-ray datasets with
various tasks, including pneumonia classification, skeletal abnormality
classification, lung segmentation, and tuberculosis (TB) detection. Comparisons
against other pre-trained models [7] confirm the proof-of-concept that
self-supervised multi-task/dataset continual pre-training could boost the
performance of X-ray image analysis.

<li>Summary: <p>In this work we pre-train a DINO-ViT based model using two Synthetic Aperture
Radar datasets (S1GRD or GSSIC) across three regions (China, Conus, Europe). We
fine-tune the models on smaller labeled datasets to predict vegetation
percentage, and empirically study the connection between the embedding space of
the models and their ability to generalize across diverse geographic regions
and to unseen data. For S1GRD, embedding spaces of different regions are
clearly separated, while GSSIC's overlaps. Positional patterns remain during
fine-tuning, and greater distances in embeddings often result in higher errors
for unfamiliar regions. With this, our work increases our understanding of
generalizability for self-supervised models applied to remote sensing.

<li>Summary: <p>Foundation models have excelled in various tasks but are often evaluated on
general benchmarks. The adaptation of these models for specific domains, such
as remote sensing imagery, remains an underexplored area. In remote sensing,
precise building instance segmentation is vital for applications like urban
planning. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) perform well, their
generalization can be limited. For this aim, we present a novel approach to
adapt foundation models to address existing models' generalization dropback.
Among several models, our focus centers on the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a
potent foundation model renowned for its prowess in class-agnostic image
segmentation capabilities. We start by identifying the limitations of SAM,
revealing its suboptimal performance when applied to remote sensing imagery.
Moreover, SAM does not offer recognition abilities and thus fails to classify
and tag localized objects. To address these limitations, we introduce different
prompting strategies, including integrating a pre-trained CNN as a prompt
generator. This novel approach augments SAM with recognition abilities, a first
of its kind. We evaluated our method on three remote sensing datasets,
including the WHU Buildings dataset, the Massachusetts Buildings dataset, and
the AICrowd Mapping Challenge. For out-of-distribution performance on the WHU
dataset, we achieve a 5.47% increase in IoU and a 4.81% improvement in
F1-score. For in-distribution performance on the WHU dataset, we observe a
2.72% and 1.58% increase in True-Positive-IoU and True-Positive-F1 score,
respectively. We intend to release our code repository, hoping to inspire
further exploration of foundation models for domain-specific tasks within the
remote sensing community.

<li>Summary: <p>Training AI models that generalize across tasks and domains has long been
among the open problems driving AI research. The emergence of Foundation Models
made it easier to obtain expert models for a given task, but the heterogeneity
of data that may be encountered at test time often means that any single expert
is insufficient. We consider the Fusion of Experts (FoE) problem of fusing
outputs of expert models with complementary knowledge of the data distribution
and formulate it as an instance of supervised learning. Our method is
applicable to both discriminative and generative tasks and leads to significant
performance improvements in image and text classification, text summarization,
multiple-choice QA, and automatic evaluation of generated text. We also extend
our method to the "frugal" setting where it is desired to reduce the number of
expert model evaluations at test time.

<li>Summary: <p>The quadratic complexity of attention in transformer architectures remains a
big bottleneck in scaling up large foundation models for long context. In fact,
recent theoretical results show the hardness of approximating the output of
softmax attention mechanism in sub-quadratic time assuming Strong Exponential
Time Hypothesis. In this paper, we show how to break this theoretical barrier
by replacing softmax with a polynomial function and polynomial sketching. In
particular we show that sketches for Polynomial Kernel from the randomized
numerical linear algebra literature can be used to approximate the polynomial
attention which leads to a significantly faster attention mechanism without
assuming any sparse structure for the attention matrix that has been done in
many previous works.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we propose an efficient block-based algorithm that lets us apply
the causal mask to the attention matrix without explicitly realizing the $n
\times n$ attention matrix and compute the output of the polynomial attention
mechanism in time linear in the context length. The block-based algorithm gives
significant speedups over the \emph{cumulative sum} algorithm used by Performer
to apply the causal mask to the attention matrix. These observations help us
design \emph{PolySketchFormer}, a practical linear-time transformer
architecture for language modeling with provable guarantees.
</p>
<p>We validate our design empirically by training language models with long
context lengths. We first show that the eval perplexities of our models are
comparable to that of models trained with softmax attention. We then show that
for large context lengths our training times are significantly faster than
FlashAttention.

<li>Summary: <p>Time series forecasting holds significant importance in many real-world
dynamic systems and has been extensively studied. Unlike natural language
process (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle
multiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized,
necessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While
pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their
development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity.
Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust
pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens.
However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time
series data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work,
we present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general
time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin
by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it
into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability
to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which
enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input
patches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected
to obtain the forecasts. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that
Time-LLM is a powerful time series learner that outperforms state-of-the-art,
specialized forecasting models. Moreover, Time-LLM excels in both few-shot and
zero-shot learning scenarios.

Deciphering Autoencoders relies solely on reconstruction error, it offers more

<li>Summary: <p>The advancement of visual intelligence is intrinsically tethered to the
availability of data. In parallel, generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has
unlocked the potential to create synthetic images that closely resemble
real-world photographs, which prompts a compelling inquiry: how visual
intelligence benefit from the advance of generative AI? This paper explores the
innovative concept of harnessing these AI-generated images as a new data
source, reshaping traditional model paradigms in visual intelligence. In
contrast to real data, AI-generated data sources exhibit remarkable advantages,
including unmatched abundance and scalability, the rapid generation of vast
datasets, and the effortless simulation of edge cases. Built on the success of
generative AI models, we examines the potential of their generated data in a
range of applications, from training machine learning models to simulating
scenarios for computational modelling, testing, and validation. We probe the
technological foundations that support this groundbreaking use of generative
AI, engaging in an in-depth discussion on the ethical, legal, and practical
considerations that accompany this transformative paradigm shift. Through an
exhaustive survey of current technologies and applications, this paper presents
a comprehensive view of the synthetic era in visual intelligence. A project

<li>Summary: <p>Remote sensing change detection between bi-temporal images receives growing
concentration from researchers. However, comparing two bi-temporal images for
detecting changes is challenging, as they demonstrate different appearances. In
this paper, we propose a dual attentive generative adversarial network for
achieving very high-resolution remote sensing image change detection tasks,
which regards the detection model as a generator and attains the optimal
weights of the detection model without increasing the parameters of the
detection model through generative-adversarial strategy, boosting the spatial
contiguity of predictions. Moreover, We design a multi-level feature extractor
for effectively fusing multi-level features, which adopts the pre-trained model
to extract multi-level features from bi-temporal images and introduces
aggregate connections to fuse them. To strengthen the identification of
multi-scale objects, we propose a multi-scale adaptive fusion module to
adaptively fuse multi-scale features through various receptive fields and
design a context refinement module to explore contextual dependencies.
Moreover, the DAGAN framework utilizes the 4-layer convolution network as a
discriminator to identify whether the synthetic image is fake or real.
Extensive experiments represent that the DAGAN framework has better performance
with 85.01% mean IoU and 91.48% mean F1 score than advanced methods on the

<li>Summary: <p>The swift advancement and widespread availability of foundational Large
Language Models (LLMs), complemented by robust fine-tuning methodologies, have
catalyzed their adaptation for innovative and industrious applications.
Enabling LLMs to recognize and interpret geospatial data, while offering a
linguistic access to vast cartographic datasets, is of significant importance.
OpenStreetMap (OSM) is the most ambitious open-source global initiative
offering detailed urban and rural geographic data, curated by a community of
over 10 million contributors, which constitutes a great potential for LLM
applications. In this study, we demonstrate the proof of concept and details of
the process of fine-tuning a relatively small scale (1B parameters) LLM with a
relatively small artificial dataset curated by a more capable teacher model, in
order to provide a linguistic interface to the OSM data of an arbitrary urban
region. Through this interface, users can inquire about a location's
attributes, covering a wide spectrum of concepts, such as its touristic appeal
or the potential profitability of various businesses in that vicinity. The
study aims to provide an initial guideline for such generative artificial
intelligence (AI) adaptations and demonstrate early signs of useful emerging
abilities in this context even in minimal computational settings. The
embeddings of artificially curated prompts including OSM data are also
investigated in detail, which might be instrumental for potential geospatially

<li>Summary: <p>Despite their ubiquity in language generation, it remains unknown why
truncation sampling heuristics like nucleus sampling are so effective. We
provide a theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of the truncation
sampling by proving that truncation methods that discard tokens below some
probability threshold (the most common type of truncation) can guarantee that
all sampled tokens have nonzero true probability. However, thresholds are a
coarse heuristic, and necessarily discard some tokens with nonzero true
probability as well. In pursuit of a more precise sampling strategy, we show
that we can leverage a known source of model errors, the softmax bottleneck, to
prove that certain tokens have nonzero true probability, without relying on a
threshold. Based on our findings, we develop an experimental truncation
strategy and the present pilot studies demonstrating the promise of this type
of algorithm. Our evaluations show that our method outperforms its
threshold-based counterparts under automatic and human evaluation metrics for
low-entropy (i.e., close to greedy) open-ended text generation. Our theoretical
findings and pilot experiments provide both insight into why truncation
sampling works, and make progress toward more expressive sampling algorithms
that better surface the generative capabilities of large language models.

<li>Summary: <p>In this study, we introduce adaptive KV cache compression, a plug-and-play
method that reduces the memory footprint of generative inference for Large
Language Models (LLMs). Different from the conventional KV cache that retains
key and value vectors for all context tokens, we conduct targeted profiling to
discern the intrinsic structure of attention modules. Based on the recognized
structure, we then construct the KV cache in an adaptive manner: evicting
long-range contexts on attention heads emphasizing local contexts, discarding
non-special tokens on attention heads centered on special tokens, and only
employing the standard KV cache for attention heads that broadly attend to all
tokens. Moreover, with the lightweight attention profiling used to guide the
construction of the adaptive KV cache, FastGen can be deployed without
resource-intensive fine-tuning or re-training. In our experiments across
various asks, FastGen demonstrates substantial reduction on GPU memory
consumption with negligible generation quality loss. We will release our code
and the compatible CUDA kernel for reproducibility.

<li>Summary: <p>Graph Neural Architecture Search (GNAS) has shown promising results in
automatically designing graph neural networks. However, GNAS still requires
intensive human labor with rich domain knowledge to design the search space and
search strategy. In this paper, we integrate GPT-4 into GNAS and propose a new
GPT-4 based Graph Neural Architecture Search method (GPT4GNAS for short). The
basic idea of our method is to design a new class of prompts for GPT-4 to guide
GPT-4 toward the generative task of graph neural architectures. The prompts
consist of descriptions of the search space, search strategy, and search
feedback of GNAS. By iteratively running GPT-4 with the prompts, GPT4GNAS
generates more accurate graph neural networks with fast convergence.
Experimental results show that embedding GPT-4 into GNAS outperforms the

<li>Summary: <p>In real-world applications, machine learning models often become obsolete due
to shifts in the joint distribution arising from underlying temporal trends, a
phenomenon known as the "concept drift". Existing works propose model-specific
strategies to achieve temporal generalization in the near-future domain.
However, the diverse characteristics of real-world datasets necessitate
customized prediction model architectures. To this end, there is an urgent
demand for a model-agnostic temporal domain generalization approach that
maintains generality across diverse data modalities and architectures. In this
work, we aim to address the concept drift problem from a data-centric
perspective to bypass considering the interaction between data and model.
Developing such a framework presents non-trivial challenges: (i) existing
generative models struggle to generate out-of-distribution future data, and
(ii) precisely capturing the temporal trends of joint distribution along
chronological source domains is computationally infeasible. To tackle the
challenges, we propose the COncept Drift simulAtor (CODA) framework
incorporating a predicted feature correlation matrix to simulate future data
for model training. Specifically, CODA leverages feature correlations to
represent data characteristics at specific time points, thereby circumventing
the daunting computational costs. Experimental results demonstrate that using
CODA-generated data as training input effectively achieves temporal domain
generalization across different model architectures.

<li>Summary: <p>Nowcasting day-ahead marginal emissions factors is increasingly important for
power systems with high flexibility and penetration of distributed energy
resources. With a significant share of firm generation from natural gas and
coal power plants, forecasting day-ahead emissions in the current energy system
has been widely studied. In contrast, as we shift to an energy system
characterized by flexible power markets, dispatchable sources, and competing
low-cost generation such as large-scale battery or hydrogen storage, system
operators will be able to choose from a mix of different generation as well as
emission pathways. To fully develop the emissions implications of a given
dispatch schedule, we need a near real-time workflow with two layers. The first
layer is a market model that continuously solves a security-constrained
economic dispatch model. The second layer determines the marginal emissions
based on the output of the market model, which is the subject of this paper. We
propose using multi-headed convolutional neural networks to generate day-ahead
forecasts of marginal and average emissions for a given independent system
operator.

<li>Summary: <p>An essential and challenging problem in causal inference is causal effect
estimation from observational data. The problem becomes more difficult with the
presence of unobserved confounding variables. The front-door adjustment is a
practical approach for dealing with unobserved confounding variables. However,
the restriction for the standard front-door adjustment is difficult to satisfy
in practice. In this paper, we relax some of the restrictions by proposing the
concept of conditional front-door (CFD) adjustment and develop the theorem that
guarantees the causal effect identifiability of CFD adjustment. Furthermore, as
it is often impossible for a CFD variable to be given in practice, it is
desirable to learn it from data. By leveraging the ability of deep generative
models, we propose CFDiVAE to learn the representation of the CFD adjustment
variable directly from data with the identifiable Variational AutoEncoder and
formally prove the model identifiability. Extensive experiments on synthetic
datasets validate the effectiveness of CFDiVAE and its superiority over
existing methods. The experiments also show that the performance of CFDiVAE is
less sensitive to the causal strength of unobserved confounding variables. We
further apply CFDiVAE to a real-world dataset to demonstrate its potential
application.

that combines a Transformer decoder, a Transformer encoder, and a predictor in
a joint generative model with shared weights. We show that training the model
with a penalized log-likelihood objective results in state-of-the-art
performance in molecule generation, while decreasing the prediction error on
newly sampled molecules, as compared to a fine-tuned decoder-only Transformer,
by 42%. Finally, we propose a probabilistic black-box optimization algorithm

during training, i.e. zero-shot sim-to-real transfer for segmentation. We focus
on the application of shipwreck segmentation in side scan sonar imagery. Our
novel segmentation network, STARS, addresses this challenge by fusing a
predicted deformation field and anomaly volume, allowing it to generalize
better to real sonar images and achieve more effective zero-shot sim-to-real
transfer for image segmentation. We evaluate the sim-to-real transfer
capabilities of our method on a real, expert-labeled side scan sonar dataset of
shipwrecks collected from field work surveys with an autonomous underwater
vehicle (AUV). STARS is trained entirely in simulation and performs zero-shot
shipwreck segmentation with no additional fine-tuning on real data. Our method
provides a significant 20% increase in segmentation performance for the
targeted shipwreck class compared to the best baseline.

restricts the advancement of VAD models. In this research, we advocate for an
expansion of VAD investigations to encompass intricate anomalies that extend
beyond conventional benchmark boundaries. To facilitate this, we introduce two
datasets, HMDB-AD and HMDB-Violence, to challenge models with diverse
action-based anomalies. These datasets are derived from the HMDB51 action
recognition dataset. We further present Multi-Frame Anomaly Detection (MFAD), a
novel method built upon the AI-VAD framework. AI-VAD utilizes single-frame
features such as pose estimation and deep image encoding, and two-frame
features such as object velocity. They then apply a density estimation
algorithm to compute anomaly scores. To address complex multi-frame anomalies,
we add a deep video encoding features capturing long-range temporal
dependencies, and logistic regression to enhance final score calculation.
Experimental results confirm our assumptions, highlighting existing models
limitations with new anomaly types. MFAD excels in both simple and complex
anomaly detection scenarios.

<li>Summary: <p>Large language and vision-language models are rapidly being deployed in
practice thanks to their impressive capabilities in instruction following,
in-context learning, and so on. This raises an urgent need to carefully analyse
their robustness so that stakeholders can understand if and when such models
are trustworthy enough to be relied upon in any given application. In this
paper, we highlight a specific vulnerability in popular models, namely
permutation sensitivity in multiple-choice question answering (MCQA).
Specifically, we show empirically that popular models are vulnerable to
adversarial permutation in answer sets for multiple-choice prompting, which is
surprising as models should ideally be as invariant to prompt permutation as
humans are. These vulnerabilities persist across various model sizes, and exist
in very recent language and vision-language models. Code is available at

<li>Summary: <p>Whole slide image (WSI) classification is a critical task in computational
pathology. However, the gigapixel-size of such images remains a major challenge
for the current state of deep-learning. Current methods rely on
multiple-instance learning (MIL) models with frozen feature extractors. Given
the the high number of instances in each image, MIL methods have long assumed
independence and permutation-invariance of patches, disregarding the tissue
structure and correlation between patches. Recent works started studying this
correlation between instances but the computational workload of such a high
number of tokens remained a limiting factor. In particular, relative position
of patches remains unaddressed. We propose to apply a straightforward encoding
module, namely a RoFormer layer , relying on memory-efficient exact
self-attention and relative positional encoding. This module can perform full
self-attention with relative position encoding on patches of large and
arbitrary shaped WSIs, solving the need for correlation between instances and
spatial modeling of tissues. We demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art MIL models on three commonly used public datasets (TCGA-NSCLC,
BRACS and Camelyon16)) on weakly supervised classification tasks. Code is

advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown potential for
human-like agents. To help these agents adapt to new tasks without extensive
human supervision, we propose the Learning through Communication (LTC)
paradigm, a novel training approach enabling LLM agents to improve continuously
through interactions with their environments and other agents. Through
iterative exploration and PPO training, LTC empowers the agent to assimilate
short-term experiences into long-term memory. To optimize agent interactions
for task-specific learning, we introduce three structured communication
patterns: Monologue, Dialogue, and Analogue-tailored for common tasks such as
decision-making, knowledge-intensive reasoning, and numerical reasoning. We
evaluated LTC on three datasets: ALFWorld (decision-making), HotpotQA
(knowledge-intensive reasoning), and GSM8k (numerical reasoning). On ALFWorld,
it exceeds the instruction tuning baseline by 12% in success rate. On HotpotQA,
LTC surpasses the instruction-tuned LLaMA-7B agent by 5.1% in EM score, and it
outperforms the instruction-tuned 9x larger PaLM-62B agent by 0.6%. On GSM8k,
LTC outperforms the CoT-Tuning baseline by 3.6% in accuracy. The results
showcase the versatility and efficiency of the LTC approach across diverse

<li>Summary: <p>Pre-trained language models (PLM) have revolutionized the NLP landscape,
achieving stellar performances across diverse tasks. These models, while
benefiting from vast training data, often require fine-tuning on specific data
to cater to distinct downstream tasks. However, this data adaptation process
has inherent security and privacy concerns, primarily when leveraging
user-generated, device-residing data. Federated learning (FL) provides a
solution, allowing collaborative model fine-tuning without centralized data
collection. However, applying FL to finetune PLMs is hampered by challenges,
including restricted model parameter access, high computational requirements,
and communication overheads. This paper introduces Federated Black-box Prompt
Tuning (FedBPT), a framework designed to address these challenges. FedBPT does
not require the clients to access the model parameters. By focusing on training
optimal prompts and utilizing gradient-free optimization methods, FedBPT
reduces the number of exchanged variables, boosts communication efficiency, and
minimizes computational and storage costs. Experiments highlight the
framework's ability to drastically cut communication and memory costs while
maintaining competitive performance. Ultimately, FedBPT presents a promising
solution for efficient, privacy-preserving fine-tuning of PLM in the age of
large language models.

<li>Summary: <p>The transformer architecture has made breakthroughs in recent years on tasks
which require modeling pairwise relationships between sequential elements, as
is the case in natural language understanding. However, transformers struggle
with long sequences due to the quadratic complexity of the attention operation,
and previous research has aimed to lower the complexity by sparsifying or
linearly approximating the attention matrix. Yet, these approaches cannot
straightforwardly distill knowledge from a teacher's attention matrix, and
often require complete retraining from scratch. Furthermore, previous sparse
and linear approaches may also lose interpretability if they do not produce
full quadratic attention matrices. To address these challenges, we propose SEA:
Sparse linear attention with an Estimated Attention mask. SEA estimates the
attention matrix with linear complexity via kernel-based linear attention, then
creates a sparse approximation to the full attention matrix with a top-k
selection to perform a sparse attention operation. For language modeling tasks
(Wikitext2), previous linear and sparse attention methods show a roughly
two-fold worse perplexity scores over the quadratic OPT-125M baseline, while
SEA achieves an even better perplexity than OPT-125M, using roughly half as
much memory as OPT-125M. Moreover, SEA maintains an interpretable attention
matrix and can utilize knowledge distillation to lower the complexity of
existing pretrained transformers. We believe that our work will have a large
practical impact, as it opens the possibility of running large transformers on
resource-limited devices with less memory.

<li>Summary: <p>Transformers have emerged as the architecture of choice for many
state-of-the-art AI models, showcasing exceptional performance across a wide
range of AI applications. However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers
limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby creating challenges for
tasks involving extended sequences or long-term dependencies. We present a
distinct approach, Ring Attention, which leverages blockwise computation of
self-attention to distribute long sequences across multiple devices while
concurrently overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the
computation of blockwise attention. By processing longer input sequences while
maintaining memory efficiency, Ring Attention enables training and inference of
sequences that are device count times longer than those of prior
memory-efficient Transformers, effectively eliminating the memory constraints
imposed by individual devices. Extensive experiments on language modeling tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of Ring Attention in allowing large sequence
input size and improving performance.

<li>Summary: <p>Monitoring network traffic to maintain the quality of service (QoS) and to
detect network intrusions in a timely and efficient manner is essential. As
network traffic is sequential, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as long
short-term memory (LSTM) are suitable for building network intrusion detection
systems. However, in the case of a few dataset examples of the rare attack
types, even these networks perform poorly. This paper proposes to use
oversampling techniques along with appropriate loss functions to handle class
imbalance for the detection of various types of network intrusions. Our deep
learning model employs LSTM with fully connected layers to perform multi-class
classification of network attacks. We enhance the representation of minority
classes: i) through the application of the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling
Technique (SMOTE), and ii) by employing categorical focal cross-entropy loss to
apply a focal factor to down-weight examples of the majority classes and focus
more on hard examples of the minority classes. Extensive experiments on KDD99
and CICIDS2017 datasets show promising results in detecting network intrusions
(with many rare attack types, e.g., Probe, R2L, DDoS, PortScan, etc.).

<li>Summary: <p>Transformers incorporating copula structures have demonstrated remarkable
performance in time series prediction. However, their heavy reliance on
self-attention mechanisms demands substantial computational resources, thus
limiting their practical utility across a wide range of tasks. In this work, we
present a model that combines the perceiver architecture with a copula
structure to enhance time-series forecasting. By leveraging the perceiver as
the encoder, we efficiently transform complex, high-dimensional, multimodal
data into a compact latent space, thereby significantly reducing computational
demands. To further reduce complexity, we introduce midpoint inference and
local attention mechanisms, enabling the model to capture dependencies within
imputed samples effectively. Subsequently, we deploy the copula-based attention
and output variance testing mechanism to capture the joint distribution of
missing data, while simultaneously mitigating error propagation during
prediction. Our experimental results on the unimodal and multimodal benchmarks
showcase a consistent 20\% improvement over the state-of-the-art methods, while
utilizing less than half of available memory resources.

<li>Summary: <p>Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD) is a novel challenging task that lies
between linguistic sense disambiguation and fine-grained multimodal retrieval.
The recent advancements in the development of visiolinguistic (VL) transformers
suggest some off-the-self implementations with encouraging results, which
however we argue that can be further improved. To this end, we propose some
knowledge-enhancement techniques towards improving the retrieval performance of
VL transformers via the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) as Knowledge
Bases. More specifically, knowledge stored in LLMs is retrieved with the help
of appropriate prompts in a zero-shot manner, achieving performance
advancements. Moreover, we convert VWSD to a purely textual question-answering
(QA) problem by considering generated image captions as multiple-choice
candidate answers. Zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies are leveraged to
explore the potential of such a transformation, while Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting in the zero-shot setting is able to reveal the internal reasoning
steps an LLM follows to select the appropriate candidate. In total, our
presented approach is the first one to analyze the merits of exploiting
knowledge stored in LLMs in different ways to solve WVSD.

<li>Summary: <p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for language models demonstrates impressive
performance across reasoning tasks, but typically needs labeled exemplars of
the reasoning process. In this work, we introduce a new prompting approach,
Analogical Prompting, designed to automatically guide the reasoning process of
large language models. Inspired by analogical reasoning, a cognitive process in
which humans draw from relevant past experiences to tackle new problems, our
approach prompts language models to self-generate relevant exemplars or
knowledge in the context, before proceeding to solve the given problem. This
method presents several advantages: it obviates the need for labeling or
retrieving exemplars, offering generality and convenience; it can also tailor
the generated exemplars and knowledge to each problem, offering adaptability.
Experimental results show that our approach outperforms 0-shot CoT and manual
few-shot CoT in a variety of reasoning tasks, including math problem solving in
GSM8K and MATH, code generation in Codeforces, and other reasoning tasks in
BIG-Bench.
