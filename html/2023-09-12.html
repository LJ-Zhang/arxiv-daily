<li>Summary: <p>Despite all recent progress, it is still challenging to edit and manipulate
natural images with modern generative models. When using Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN), one major hurdle is in the inversion process mapping a real
image to its corresponding noise vector in the latent space, since its
necessary to be able to reconstruct an image to edit its contents. Likewise for
Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM), the linearization assumption in
each inversion step makes the whole deterministic inversion process unreliable.
Existing approaches that have tackled the problem of inversion stability often
incur in significant trade-offs in computational efficiency. In this work we
propose an Accelerated Iterative Diffusion Inversion method, dubbed AIDI, that
significantly improves reconstruction accuracy with minimal additional overhead
in space and time complexity. By using a novel blended guidance technique, we
show that effective results can be obtained on a large range of image editing
tasks without large classifier-free guidance in inversion. Furthermore, when
compared with other diffusion inversion based works, our proposed process is
shown to be more robust for fast image editing in the 10 and 20 diffusion
steps' regimes.

<li>Summary: <p>Numerous diffusion models have recently been applied to image synthesis and
editing. However, editing 3D scenes is still in its early stages. It poses
various challenges, such as the requirement to design specific methods for
different editing types, retraining new models for various 3D scenes, and the
absence of convenient human interaction during editing. To tackle these issues,
we introduce a text-driven editing method, termed DN2N, which allows for the
direct acquisition of a NeRF model with universal editing capabilities,
eliminating the requirement for retraining. Our method employs off-the-shelf
text-based editing models of 2D images to modify the 3D scene images, followed
by a filtering process to discard poorly edited images that disrupt 3D
consistency. We then consider the remaining inconsistency as a problem of
removing noise perturbation, which can be solved by generating training data
with similar perturbation characteristics for training. We further propose
cross-view regularization terms to help the generalized NeRF model mitigate
these perturbations. Our text-driven method allows users to edit a 3D scene
with their desired description, which is more friendly, intuitive, and
practical than prior works. Empirical results show that our method achieves
multiple editing types, including but not limited to appearance editing,
weather transition, material changing, and style transfer. Most importantly,
our method generalizes well with editing abilities shared among a set of model
parameters without requiring a customized editing model for some specific
scenes, thus inferring novel views with editing effects directly from user
input. The project website is available at <a href="http://sk-fun.fun/DN2N">this http URL</a>

<li>Summary: <p>While impressive performance has been achieved in image captioning, the
limited diversity of the generated captions and the large parameter scale
remain major barriers to the real-word application of these systems. In this
work, we propose a lightweight image captioning network in combination with
continuous diffusion, called Prefix-diffusion. To achieve diversity, we design
an efficient method that injects prefix image embeddings into the denoising
process of the diffusion model. In order to reduce trainable parameters, we
employ a pre-trained model to extract image features and further design an
extra mapping network. Prefix-diffusion is able to generate diverse captions
with relatively less parameters, while maintaining the fluency and relevance of
the captions benefiting from the generative capabilities of the diffusion
model. Our work paves the way for scaling up diffusion models for image
captioning, and achieves promising performance compared with recent approaches.

<li>Summary: <p>Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved considerable success in
generation tasks. As sampling from DPMs is equivalent to solving diffusion SDE
or ODE which is time-consuming, numerous fast sampling methods built upon
improved differential equation solvers are proposed. The majority of such
techniques consider solving the diffusion ODE due to its superior efficiency.
However, stochastic sampling could offer additional advantages in generating
diverse and high-quality data. In this work, we engage in a comprehensive
analysis of stochastic sampling from two aspects: variance-controlled diffusion
SDE and linear multi-step SDE solver. Based on our analysis, we propose
SA-Solver, which is an improved efficient stochastic Adams method for solving
diffusion SDE to generate data with high quality. Our experiments show that
SA-Solver achieves: 1) improved or comparable performance compared with the
existing state-of-the-art sampling methods for few-step sampling; 2) SOTA FID
scores on substantial benchmark datasets under a suitable number of function
evaluations (NFEs).

<li>Summary: <p>Data collected from the real world typically exhibit long-tailed
distributions, where frequent classes contain abundant data while rare ones
have only a limited number of samples. While existing supervised learning
approaches have been proposed to tackle such data imbalance, the requirement of
label supervision would limit their applicability to real-world scenarios in
which label annotation might not be available. Without the access to class
labels nor the associated class frequencies, we propose Frequency-Aware
Self-Supervised Learning (FASSL) in this paper. Targeting at learning from
unlabeled data with inherent long-tailed distributions, the goal of FASSL is to
produce discriminative feature representations for downstream classification
tasks. In FASSL, we first learn frequency-aware prototypes, reflecting the
associated long-tailed distribution. Particularly focusing on rare-class
samples, the relationships between image data and the derived prototypes are
further exploited with the introduced self-supervised learning scheme.
Experiments on long-tailed image datasets quantitatively and qualitatively
verify the effectiveness of our learning scheme.

<li>Summary: <p>Face forgery videos have caused severe social public concern, and various
detectors have been proposed recently. However, most of them are trained in a
supervised manner with limited generalization when detecting videos from
different forgery methods or real source videos. To tackle this issue, we
explore to take full advantage of the difference between real and forgery
videos by only exploring the common representation of real face videos. In this
paper, a Self-supervised Transformer cooperating with Contrastive and
Reconstruction learning (CoReST) is proposed, which is first pre-trained only
on real face videos in a self-supervised manner, and then fine-tuned a linear
head on specific face forgery video datasets. Two specific auxiliary tasks
incorporated contrastive and reconstruction learning are designed to enhance
the representation learning. Furthermore, a Domain Adaptive Reconstruction
(DAR) module is introduced to bridge the gap between different forgery domains
by reconstructing on unlabeled target videos when fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method performs
even better than the state-of-the-art supervised competitors with impressive
generalization.

<li>Summary: <p>Graph clustering, which learns the node representations for effective cluster
assignments, is a fundamental yet challenging task in data analysis and has
received considerable attention accompanied by graph neural networks in recent
years. However, most existing methods overlook the inherent relational
information among the non-independent and non-identically distributed nodes in
a graph. Due to the lack of exploration of relational attributes, the semantic
information of the graph-structured data fails to be fully exploited which
leads to poor clustering performance. In this paper, we propose a novel
self-supervised deep graph clustering method named Relational Redundancy-Free
Graph Clustering (R$^2$FGC) to tackle the problem. It extracts the attribute-
and structure-level relational information from both global and local views
based on an autoencoder and a graph autoencoder. To obtain effective
representations of the semantic information, we preserve the consistent
relation among augmented nodes, whereas the redundant relation is further
reduced for learning discriminative embeddings. In addition, a simple yet valid
strategy is utilized to alleviate the over-smoothing issue. Extensive
experiments are performed on widely used benchmark datasets to validate the
superiority of our R$^2$FGC over state-of-the-art baselines. Our codes are

<li>Summary: <p>Recently, the remarkable advance of the Large Language Model (LLM) has
inspired researchers to transfer its extraordinary reasoning capability to data
across several modalities. The prevailing approaches primarily regard visual
input as the prompt and focus exclusively on optimizing the text generation
process conditioned upon vision content by a frozen LLM. Such an inequitable
treatment of vision and language heavily constrains the model's potential. In
this paper, we break through this limitation by representing both vision and
language in a unified representation. To this end, we craft a visual tokenizer
that translates the non-linguistic image into a sequence of discrete tokens
like a foreign language that LLM can read. The resulting visual tokens
encompass high-level semantics worthy of a word and also support dynamic
sequence length varying from the image content. Coped with this visual
tokenizer, the presented foundation model called LaVIT (Language-VIsion
Transformer) can handle both image and text indiscriminately under a unified
generative learning paradigm. Pre-trained on the web-scale image-text corpus,
LaVIT is empowered with impressive multi-modal comprehension capability. The
extensive experiments showcase that it outperforms existing models by a large
margin on downstream tasks. Our code and models will be available at

<li>Summary: <p>We present SeaEval, a benchmark for multilingual foundation models. In
addition to characterizing how these models understand and reason with natural
language, we also investigate how well they comprehend cultural practices,
nuances, and values. Alongside standard accuracy metrics, we investigate the
brittleness of foundation models in the dimensions of semantics and
multilinguality. Our analyses span both open-sourced and closed models, leading
to empirical results across classic NLP tasks, reasoning, and cultural
comprehension. Key findings indicate (1) Most models exhibit varied behavior
when given paraphrased instructions. (2) Many models still suffer from exposure
bias (e.g., positional bias, majority label bias). (3) For questions rooted in
factual, scientific, and commonsense knowledge, consistent responses are
expected across multilingual queries that are semantically equivalent. Yet,
most models surprisingly demonstrate inconsistent performance on these queries.
(4) Multilingually-trained models have not attained "balanced multilingual"
capabilities. Our endeavors underscore the need for more generalizable semantic
representations and enhanced multilingual contextualization. SeaEval can serve
as a launchpad for more thorough investigations and evaluations for
multilingual and multicultural scenarios.

<li>Summary: <p>Previous text-to-image synthesis algorithms typically use explicit textual
instructions to generate/manipulate images accurately, but they have difficulty
adapting to guidance in the form of coarsely matched texts. In this work, we
attempt to stylize an input image using such coarsely matched text as guidance.
To tackle this new problem, we introduce a novel task called text-based style
generation and propose a two-stage generative adversarial network: the first
stage generates the overall image style with a sentence feature, and the second
stage refines the generated style with a synthetic feature, which is produced
by a multi-modality style synthesis module. We re-filter one existing dataset
and collect a new dataset for the task. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies are conducted to validate our framework. The practical potential of our
work is demonstrated by various applications such as text-image alignment and
story visualization. Our datasets are published at

<li>Summary: <p>Unsupervised learning of 3D-aware generative adversarial networks has lately
made much progress. Some recent work demonstrates promising results of learning
human generative models using neural articulated radiance fields, yet their
generalization ability and controllability lag behind parametric human models,
i.e., they do not perform well when generalizing to novel pose/shape and are
not part controllable. To solve these problems, we propose VeRi3D, a generative
human vertex-based radiance field parameterized by vertices of the parametric
human template, SMPL. We map each 3D point to the local coordinate system
defined on its neighboring vertices, and use the corresponding vertex feature
and local coordinates for mapping it to color and density values. We
demonstrate that our simple approach allows for generating photorealistic human
images with free control over camera pose, human pose, shape, as well as
enabling part-level editing.

<li>Summary: <p>Recent works have demonstrated the superiority of supervised Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) in learning hierarchical representations from time
series data for successful classification. These methods require sufficiently
large labeled data for stable learning, however acquiring high-quality labeled
time series data can be costly and potentially infeasible. Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved great success in enhancing
unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. Nonetheless, to our best knowledge,
it remains unclear how effectively GANs can serve as a general-purpose solution
to learn representations for time series recognition, i.e., classification and
clustering. The above considerations inspire us to introduce a Time-series
Convolutional GAN (TCGAN). TCGAN learns by playing an adversarial game between
two one-dimensional CNNs (i.e., a generator and a discriminator) in the absence
of label information. Parts of the trained TCGAN are then reused to construct a
representation encoder to empower linear recognition methods. We conducted
comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. The results
demonstrate that TCGAN is faster and more accurate than existing time-series
GANs. The learned representations enable simple classification and clustering
methods to achieve superior and stable performance. Furthermore, TCGAN retains
high efficacy in scenarios with few-labeled and imbalanced-labeled data. Our
work provides a promising path to effectively utilize abundant unlabeled time
series data.

<li>Summary: <p>Generative models have gained popularity for their potential applications in
imaging science, such as image reconstruction, posterior sampling and data
sharing. Flow-based generative models are particularly attractive due to their
ability to tractably provide exact density estimates along with fast,
inexpensive and diverse samples. Training such models, however, requires a
large, high quality dataset of objects. In applications such as computed
imaging, it is often difficult to acquire such data due to requirements such as
long acquisition time or high radiation dose, while acquiring noisy or
partially observed measurements of these objects is more feasible. In this
work, we propose AmbientFlow, a framework for learning flow-based generative
models directly from noisy and incomplete data. Using variational Bayesian
methods, a novel framework for establishing flow-based generative models from
noisy, incomplete data is proposed. Extensive numerical studies demonstrate the
effectiveness of AmbientFlow in correctly learning the object distribution. The
utility of AmbientFlow in a downstream inference task of image reconstruction
is demonstrated.

<li>Summary: <p>Segmenting unknown or anomalous object instances is a critical task in
autonomous driving applications, and it is approached traditionally as a
per-pixel classification problem. However, reasoning individually about each
pixel without considering their contextual semantics results in high
uncertainty around the objects' boundaries and numerous false positives. We
propose a paradigm change by shifting from a per-pixel classification to a mask
classification. Our mask-based method, Mask2Anomaly, demonstrates the
feasibility of integrating a mask-classification architecture to jointly
address anomaly segmentation, open-set semantic segmentation, and open-set
panoptic segmentation. Mask2Anomaly includes several technical novelties that
are designed to improve the detection of anomalies/unknown objects: i) a global
masked attention module to focus individually on the foreground and background
regions; ii) a mask contrastive learning that maximizes the margin between an
anomaly and known classes; iii) a mask refinement solution to reduce false
positives; and iv) a novel approach to mine unknown instances based on the
mask-architecture properties. By comprehensive qualitative and qualitative
evaluation, we show Mask2Anomaly achieves new state-of-the-art results across

<li>Summary: <p>Cyber-physical systems (CPSs), like train control and management systems
(TCMS), are becoming ubiquitous in critical infrastructures. As safety-critical
systems, ensuring their dependability during operation is crucial. Digital
twins (DTs) have been increasingly studied for this purpose owing to their
capability of runtime monitoring and warning, prediction and detection of
anomalies, etc. However, constructing a DT for anomaly detection in TCMS
necessitates sufficient training data and extracting both chronological and
context features with high quality. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel
method named KDDT for TCMS anomaly detection. KDDT harnesses a language model
(LM) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract contexts and
chronological features, respectively. To enrich data volume, KDDT benefits from
out-of-domain data with knowledge distillation (KD). We evaluated KDDT with two
datasets from our industry partner Alstom and obtained the F1 scores of 0.931
and 0.915, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of KDDT. We also
explored individual contributions of the DT model, LM, and KD to the overall
performance of KDDT, via a comprehensive empirical study, and observed average

<li>Summary: <p>Learning paradigms for large language models (LLMs) currently tend to fall
within either in-context learning (ICL) or full fine-tuning. Each of these
comes with their own trade-offs based on available data, model size, compute
cost, ease-of-use, and final quality with neither solution performing well
across-the-board. In this article, we first describe ICL and fine-tuning
paradigms in a way that highlights their natural connections. Based on these
connections, we propose a new learning paradigm called FIAT that fuses the best
of these paradigms together, enabling prompt-engineered instructions and
chain-of-thought reasoning with the very largest models while also using
similar methods to perform parameter updates on a modestly-sized LLM with
parameter-efficient tuning. We evaluate FIAT's effectiveness on a variety of
multilingual tasks and observe that FIAT performs better than both ICL and
fine-tuning at scales ranging from 100-10,000 training examples. We hope that
FIAT provides a practical way of harnessing the full potential of LLMs without
needing to make a hard choice between learning paradigms.

<li>Summary: <p>Current methods for Knowledge-Based Question Answering (KBQA) usually rely on
complex training techniques and model frameworks, leading to many limitations
in practical applications. Recently, the emergence of In-Context Learning (ICL)
capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) provides a simple and
training-free semantic parsing paradigm for KBQA: Given a small number of
questions and their labeled logical forms as demo examples, LLMs can understand
the task intent and generate the logic form for a new question. However,
current powerful LLMs have little exposure to logic forms during pre-training,
resulting in a high format error rate. To solve this problem, we propose a
code-style in-context learning method for KBQA, which converts the generation
process of unfamiliar logical form into the more familiar code generation
process for LLMs. Experimental results on three mainstream datasets show that
our method dramatically mitigated the formatting error problem in generating
logic forms while realizing a new SOTA on WebQSP, GrailQA, and GraphQ under the
few-shot setting.

performance can be achieved with more demonstrations. However, asking the users
to write the demonstrations can be cumbersome. As a simple yet cost-effective
workaround, this paper proposes a novel method called EPA (\textbf{E}asy
\textbf{P}rompt \textbf{A}ugmentation)\footnote{While this paper considers
augmenting prompts via demonstrations, we name it EPA as the name EDA is
already taken by a well-known NLP method \citep{wei-zou-2019-eda}.} that
effectively minimizes user efforts in writing demonstrations while improving
the model performance at the same time. EPA achieves these goals by
automatically augmenting the demonstrations with multiple sources/targets,
where each of them paraphrases each other. This is well motivated as augmenting
data via paraphrasing effectively improves neural language models. EPA thus
employs paraphrasing as an augmentation method for in-context learning.
Extensive experiments indicate that EPA effectively improves both NLU and NLG
tasks, covering from natural language inference to machine translation in
translating tens of languages.\footnote{Code and data will be released upon
publication.}

<li>Summary: <p>In the real world, knowledge often exists in a multimodal and heterogeneous
form. Addressing the task of question answering with hybrid data types,
including text, tables, and images, is a challenging task (MMHQA). Recently,
with the rise of large language models (LLM), in-context learning (ICL) has
become the most popular way to solve QA problems. We propose MMHQA-ICL
framework for addressing this problems, which includes stronger heterogeneous
data retriever and an image caption module. Most importantly, we propose a
Type-specific In-context Learning Strategy for MMHQA, enabling LLMs to leverage
their powerful performance in this task. We are the first to use end-to-end LLM
prompting method for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that our
framework outperforms all baselines and methods trained on the full dataset,
achieving state-of-the-art results under the few-shot setting on the
MultimodalQA dataset.

<li>Summary: <p>Multi-scale resolution training has seen an increased adoption across
multiple vision tasks, including classification and detection. Training with
smaller resolutions enables faster training at the expense of a drop in
accuracy. Conversely, training with larger resolutions has been shown to
improve performance, but memory constraints often make this infeasible. In this
paper, we empirically study the properties of multi-scale training procedures.
We focus on variable batch size multi-scale data samplers that randomly sample
an input resolution at each training iteration and dynamically adjust their
batch size according to the resolution. Such samplers have been shown to
improve model accuracy beyond standard training with a fixed batch size and
resolution, though it is not clear why this is the case. We explore the
properties of these data samplers by performing extensive experiments on
ResNet-101 and validate our conclusions across multiple architectures, tasks,
and datasets. We show that multi-scale samplers behave as implicit data
regularizers and accelerate training speed. Compared to models trained with
single-scale samplers, we show that models trained with multi-scale samplers
retain or improve accuracy, while being better-calibrated and more robust to
scaling and data distribution shifts. We additionally extend a multi-scale
variable batch sampler with a simple curriculum that progressively grows
resolutions throughout training, allowing for a compute reduction of more than
30%. We show that the benefits of multi-scale training extend to detection and
instance segmentation tasks, where we observe a 37% reduction in training FLOPs
along with a 3-4% mAP increase on MS-COCO using a Mask R-CNN model.

<li>Summary: <p>Bayesian optimization (BO) suffers from long computing times when processing
highly-dimensional or large data sets. These long computing times are a result
of the Gaussian process surrogate model having a polynomial time complexity
with the number of experiments. Running BO on high-dimensional or massive data
sets becomes intractable due to this time complexity scaling, in turn,
hindering experimentation. Alternative surrogate models have been developed to
reduce the computing utilization of the BO procedure, however, these methods
require mathematical alteration of the inherit surrogate function, pigeonholing
use into only that function. In this paper, we demonstrate a generalizable BO
wrapper of memory pruning and bounded optimization, capable of being used with
any surrogate model and acquisition function. Using this memory pruning
approach, we show a decrease in wall-clock computing times per experiment of BO
from a polynomially increasing pattern to a sawtooth pattern that has a
non-increasing trend without sacrificing convergence performance. Furthermore,
we illustrate the generalizability of the approach across two unique data sets,
two unique surrogate models, and four unique acquisition functions. All model
implementations are run on the MIT Supercloud state-of-the-art computing
hardware.

<li>Summary: <p>The ability of graph neural networks (GNNs) to count certain graph
substructures, especially cycles, is important for the success of GNNs on a
wide range of tasks. It has been recently used as a popular metric for
evaluating the expressive power of GNNs. Many of the proposed GNN models with
provable cycle counting power are based on subgraph GNNs, i.e., extracting a
bag of subgraphs from the input graph, generating representations for each
subgraph, and using them to augment the representation of the input graph.
However, those methods require heavy preprocessing, and suffer from high time
and memory costs. In this paper, we overcome the aforementioned limitations of
subgraph GNNs by proposing a novel class of GNNs -- $d$-Distance-Restricted
FWL(2) GNNs, or $d$-DRFWL(2) GNNs. $d$-DRFWL(2) GNNs use node pairs whose
mutual distances are at most $d$ as the units for message passing to balance
the expressive power and complexity. By performing message passing among
distance-restricted node pairs in the original graph, $d$-DRFWL(2) GNNs avoid
the expensive subgraph extraction operations in subgraph GNNs, making both the
time and space complexity lower. We theoretically show that the discriminative
power of $d$-DRFWL(2) GNNs strictly increases as $d$ increases. More
importantly, $d$-DRFWL(2) GNNs have provably strong cycle counting power even
with $d=2$: they can count all 3, 4, 5, 6-cycles. Since 6-cycles (e.g., benzene
rings) are ubiquitous in organic molecules, being able to detect and count them
is crucial for achieving robust and generalizable performance on molecular
tasks. Experiments on both synthetic datasets and molecular datasets verify our
theory. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the most efficient GNN model
to date (both theoretically and empirically) that can count up to 6-cycles.

<li>Summary: <p>Automated segmentation of large volumes of medical images is often plagued by
the limited availability of fully annotated data and the diversity of organ
surface properties resulting from the use of different acquisition protocols
for different patients. In this paper, we introduce a more promising few-shot
learning-based method named Region-enhanced Prototypical Transformer (RPT) to
mitigate the effects of large intra-class diversity/bias. First, a subdivision
strategy is introduced to produce a collection of regional prototypes from the
foreground of the support prototype. Second, a self-selection mechanism is
proposed to incorporate into the Bias-alleviated Transformer (BaT) block to
suppress or remove interferences present in the query prototype and regional
support prototypes. By stacking BaT blocks, the proposed RPT can iteratively
optimize the generated regional prototypes and finally produce rectified and
more accurate global prototypes for Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation (FSMS).
Extensive experiments are conducted on three publicly available medical image
datasets, and the obtained results show consistent improvements compared to
state-of-the-art FSMS methods. The source code is available at:

<li>Summary: <p>Generalized Few-Shot Intent Detection (GFSID) is challenging and realistic
because it needs to categorize both seen and novel intents simultaneously.
Previous GFSID methods rely on the episodic learning paradigm, which makes it
hard to extend to a generalized setup as they do not explicitly learn the
classification of seen categories and the knowledge of seen intents. To address
the dilemma, we propose to convert the GFSID task into the class incremental
learning paradigm. Specifically, we propose a two-stage learning framework,
which sequentially learns the knowledge of different intents in various periods
via prompt learning. And then we exploit prototypes for categorizing both seen
and novel intents. Furthermore, to achieve the transfer knowledge of intents in
different stages, for different scenarios we design two knowledge preservation
methods which close to realistic applications. Extensive experiments and
detailed analyses on two widely used datasets show that our framework based on
the class incremental learning paradigm achieves promising performance.
