* Summary: Although deep neural networks enable impressive visual perception performance
for autonomous driving, their robustness to varying weather conditions still
requires attention. When adapting these models for changed environments, such
as different weather conditions, they are prone to forgetting previously
learned information. This catastrophic forgetting is typically addressed via
incremental learning approaches which usually re-train the model by either
keeping a memory bank of training samples or keeping a copy of the entire model
or model parameters for each scenario. While these approaches show impressive
results, they can be prone to scalability issues and their applicability for
autonomous driving in all weather conditions has not been shown. In this paper
we propose DISC -- Domain Incremental through Statistical Correction -- a
simple online zero-forgetting approach which can incrementally learn new tasks
(i.e weather conditions) without requiring re-training or expensive memory
banks. The only information we store for each task are the statistical
parameters as we categorize each domain by the change in first and second order
statistics. Thus, as each task arrives, we simply 'plug and play' the
statistical vectors for the corresponding task into the model and it
immediately starts to perform well on that task. We show the efficacy of our
approach by testing it for object detection in a challenging domain-incremental
autonomous driving scenario where we encounter different adverse weather
conditions, such as heavy rain, fog, and snow.

### Title: Radio Galaxy Zoo: Using semi-supervised learning to leverage large unlabelled data-sets for radio galaxy classification under data-set shift

* Summary: In this work we examine the classification accuracy and robustness of a
state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithm applied to the
morphological classification of radio galaxies. We test if SSL with fewer
labels can achieve test accuracies comparable to the supervised
state-of-the-art and whether this holds when incorporating previously unseen
data. We find that for the radio galaxy classification problem considered, SSL
provides additional regularisation and outperforms the baseline test accuracy.
However, in contrast to model performance metrics reported on computer science
benchmarking data-sets, we find that improvement is limited to a narrow range
of label volumes, with performance falling off rapidly at low label volumes.
Additionally, we show that SSL does not improve model calibration, regardless
of whether classification is improved. Moreover, we find that when different
underlying catalogues drawn from the same radio survey are used to provide the
labelled and unlabelled data-sets required for SSL, a significant drop in
classification performance is observered, highlighting the difficulty of
applying SSL techniques under dataset shift. We show that a class-imbalanced
unlabelled data pool negatively affects performance through prior probability
shift, which we suggest may explain this performance drop, and that using the
Frechet Distance between labelled and unlabelled data-sets as a measure of
data-set shift can provide a prediction of model performance, but that for
typical radio galaxy data-sets with labelled sample volumes of O(1000), the
sample variance associated with this technique is high and the technique is in
general not sufficiently robust to replace a train-test cycle.

### Title: Learning Forward Dynamics Model and Informed Trajectory Sampler for Safe Quadruped Navigation

* Summary: For autonomous quadruped robot navigation in various complex environments, a
typical SOTA system is composed of four main modules -- mapper, global planner,
local planner, and command-tracking controller -- in a hierarchical manner. In
this paper, we build a robust and safe local planner which is designed to
generate a velocity plan to track a coarsely planned path from the global
planner. Previous works used waypoint-based methods (e.g.
Proportional-Differential control and pure pursuit) which simplify the path
tracking problem to local point-goal navigation. However, they suffer from
frequent collisions in geometrically complex and narrow environments because of
two reasons; the global planner uses a coarse and inaccurate model and the
local planner is unable to track the global plan sufficiently well. Currently,
deep learning methods are an appealing alternative because they can learn
safety and path feasibility from experience more accurately. However, existing
deep learning methods are not capable of planning for a long horizon. In this
work, we propose a learning-based fully autonomous navigation framework
composed of three innovative elements: a learned forward dynamics model (FDM),
an online sampling-based model-predictive controller, and an informed
trajectory sampler (ITS). Using our framework, a quadruped robot can
autonomously navigate in various complex environments without a collision and
generate a smoother command plan compared to the baseline method. Furthermore,
our method can reactively handle unexpected obstacles on the planned path and
avoid them. Project page
