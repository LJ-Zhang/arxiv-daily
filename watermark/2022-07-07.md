* Summary: Videos are prone to tampering attacks that alter the meaning and deceive the
audience. Previous video forgery detection schemes find tiny clues to locate
the tampered areas. However, attackers can successfully evade supervision by
destroying such clues using video compression or blurring. This paper proposes
a video watermarking network for tampering localization. We jointly train a
3D-UNet-based watermark embedding network and a decoder that predicts the
tampering mask. The perturbation made by watermark embedding is close to
imperceptible. Considering that there is no off-the-shelf differentiable video
codec simulator, we propose to mimic video compression by ensembling simulation
results of other typical attacks, e.g., JPEG compression and blurring, as an
approximation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
watermarked videos with good imperceptibility and robustly and accurately
locates tampered areas within the attacked version.
